    "# NLP Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is designed to generalize the fit/predict to entire end to end pipelines for text. It can be used as individual methods or as a pipeline object to manage execution of training and/or testing. See README.md for an overview of which methods are in here.\n",

    "## This Demo Set\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of demos walks through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic Usage Demos** Using abstract/toy datasets to show how to use this library.\n",
    "  * **Usage of the library as individual methods**: Using each of the methods manually to get results.\n",
    "  * **Usage of the pipeline constructor**: A reimplementaiton of the examples above using the pipeline object.\n",
    "  * **Saving and loading trained pipelines**: Quick guidance on how to separate training and running/prediction.\n",
    "* **Practical Demos**: With real data and justifying decisions on pipeline design.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Clustering**: A real end-to-end example on clustering, where \"clustering\" is picking some set of groups without explicit mapping to classes.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Classification**: A real end-to-end example on classification, where \"classificaiton\" is picking which of a set of classes best apply to a document.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Extractive Labeling**: A real end-to-end example on extractive labeling, where \"extractive labeling\" is picking which words or phrases in a document \"seem important\", like automatic keyword extraction.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Extractive Labeling**: A real end-to-end example on predictive labeling, where a set of possible labels is chosen a prioro, and between none and all of the possible labels may apply to a document.\n",
    "  * **(WIP) Practical Demo: Mixing Methods**:  A real end-to-end example on using different kinds of methods together to get simpler results.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE that this is not intended to be an exhaustive demo of all of the different methods: `test_demos.ipynb` may be a better choice for that."

We'll need a dataset with no truths (true labels are called \"truths\" in this library) for clustering and extractive labeling (n.b. this is not strictly necessary, clustering and extractive labeling methods will simply ignore truths, so including them here is likely to be confusing), one with classes for classification, and one with lists of labels as truths for labeling."
