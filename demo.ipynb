    "\n",
    "This package is designed to generalize the fit/predict to entire end to end pipelines for text. It can be used as individual methods or as a pipeline object to manage execution of training and/or testing. See README.md for an overview of which methods are in here.\n",

    "## This Demo Set\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of demos walks through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic Usage Demos** Using abstract/toy datasets to show how to use this library.\n",
    "  * **Usage of the library as individual methods**: Using each of the methods manually to get results.\n",
    "  * **Usage of the pipeline constructor**: A reimplementaiton of the examples above using the pipeline object.\n",
    "  * **Saving and loading trained pipelines**: Quick guidance on how to separate training and running/prediction.\n",
    "* **Practical Demos**: With real data and justifying decisions on pipeline design.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Clustering**: A real end-to-end example on clustering, where \"clustering\" is picking some set of groups without explicit mapping to classes.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Classification**: A real end-to-end example on classification, where \"classificaiton\" is picking which of a set of classes best apply to a document.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Extractive Labeling**: A real end-to-end example on extractive labeling, where \"extractive labeling\" is picking which words or phrases in a document \"seem important\", like automatic keyword extraction.\n",
    "  * **Practical Demo: Extractive Labeling**: A real end-to-end example on predictive labeling, where a set of possible labels is chosen a prioro, and between none and all of the possible labels may apply to a document.\n",
    "  * **(WIP) Practical Demo: Mixing Methods**:  A real end-to-end example on using different kinds of methods together to get simpler results.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE that this is not intended to be an exhaustive demo of all of the different methods: `test_demos.ipynb` may be a better choice for that."

Moreover, we investigated the mediating role of perceived stress on these associations. Methods A total of 677 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Based on the Reliable Change Index (RCI), HADS trajectories were defined at two intervals: (1) pre-pandemic-confinement (follow-up =\\u20092,28\\u2009±\\u20090,84 years); (2) confinement-post-confinement (follow-up =\\u20091,49\\u2009±\\u20090,12 years). Then, 4 trajectory groups were defined: Psychological Resilience ( n \\u2009=\\u2009448, stable or improve at both intervals), Descending ( n \\u2009=\\u200984, stable/improve [interval 1]-worsen [interval 2]), Recovery ( n \\u2009=\\u200959, worsening [interval 1], improvement [interval 2] ) and Non-resilient ( n \\u2009=\\u200986, worsening at both intervals). Logistic regression models (LRM) were applied considering lifestyle (physical and leisure activities, sleep) and psychosocial factors (social relationships and emotional support) as predictors of psychological resilience trajectory (i.e., outcome) at both intervals. Finally, mediation analyses were carried out to test the effect of perceived stress on the relationships between the predictive factors and psychological resilience. Results Our finding showed that most participants followed a psychological resilient trajectory (66,1%). LRMs indicated that higher physical activity level, a greater number of social interactions and longer sleep duration were significantly associated with a psychological resilience trajectory both at confinement and at the 1.5 years follow-up. Lastly, the mediation analyses suggested that these factors influence psychological resilience through the mitigation of perceived stress. Conclusion These findings underscore the role of physical activity, social interactions and sleep quality to strengthen individuals’ capacity to cope with stress during prolonged crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These lifestyle and psychological factors may be valuable targets for public health strategies aimed to prevent mental health problems.', 'Purpose Serviced Housing for Older People (SHOP) in Japan offers barrier-free living environments and supportive services to enhance the health and well-being of older adults. This study aimed to compare the health and well-being of SHOP residents with community-dwelling older adults and to compare factors that may influence them. Methods This cross-sectional study utilized propensity score matching to compare the health and well-being of 1,080 SHOP residents (69.4% female; mean age: 83.9 years) with 7,560 community-dwelling older adults (67.8% female; mean age: 84.1 years) from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study. Health and well-being were assessed using nine items. Additionally, social behaviours and social factors such as laughing frequency, regular outings, hobbies, depression, participation in preventive care activities, meeting friends frequently, emotional support, and eating with others, were compared. Results SHOP residents exhibited significantly higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction, and physical health compared to community-dwelling older adults. They were more engaged in activities like regular outings, attending preventive care activities, meeting friends, and eating with others. They also reported higher frequencies of laughter and received emotional support. Conclusion SHOP may improve the health and well-being of older adults. These findings can help in developing age-friendly housing initiatives to address the challenges of an aging society.']... +98 more\n",

      "Texts: ['Purpose Disparities in mental health across sexual orientation groups and among young adults have long been discussed. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the moderating effects of sexual orientation on the associations between social factors and depressive symptoms as well as suicidal ideation in young adults. Methods The study included 6,337 participants aged 18–25y in 2022 from the French EpiCov cohort. The outcome variables were depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Poisson regressions with robust error variance were performed to investigate the associations between social factors and outcomes according to sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, other, or not defining themselves according to their sexuality: sexual minority (SM); heterosexual or not wishing to answer: Not belonging to SM (NSM)). Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation was higher in the SM than in the NSM group. Regarding depressive symptoms, significant moderating effects of sexual orientation were observed for female vs male sex (NSM: adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) 1.58[1.28–1.95], SM: aPR 1.03[0.78–1.36]) and age category 22–25y vs 18-21y (NSM: aPR 1.32[1.05–1.67], SM: aPR 0.78[0.59–1.03]). Regarding suicidal ideation, significant moderating effect was observed for not being vs being in a relationship (NSM: aPR 1.55[1.14–2.12], SM: aPR 0.82[0.59–1.13]). Conclusion In this study conducted in 2022, well-known social risk factors of mental problems do not explain the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among young SM group. Further studies are needed to understand the specific challenges faced by these young people.', 'Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global population was exposed to a significant psychological stress, which had an impact on the mental health in individuals with pre-existing mental disorders. Despite their heightened vulnerability, subgroups within this population demonstrated resilient outcomes throughout the pandemic. This study aims to identify predictors of long-term, sustained resilient outcomes among people with a history of mental disorder during the first two years of the pandemic. Methods In this international 2-year, 5-wave longitudinal online survey, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the PTSD Checklist DSM-5 were used for a proxy measure of psychological distress. As possible predictors of sustained resilient outcomes, we investigated socio-demographic characteristics, economic and housing status, pandemic-related issues, chronic diseases, social support, fear of contamination and personal values which were investigated respectively through the Oslo Social Support Scale, the Padua Inventory, and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Data were analysed with a Mover-Stayer Latent Transition Analysis model. Results Nine-hundred and forty-three participants with a mental disorder were included in the analysis. Variables associated with a higher chance of sustained resilient outcomes were older age, maintaining a job, and having more people in the household. In contrast, female gender, losing job, difficulty in meeting basic needs, higher fear of contamination, hedonism, less social support and loneliness resulted in a lower likelihood of presenting sustained resilient outcomes. Conclusion This study identified factors that predictsustained resilience in people with mental disorders. The newly discovered predictors could prove invaluable in developing strategies to enhance the resilience of people with mental disorders during times of crises, such as pandemics.']... +147 more\n",
