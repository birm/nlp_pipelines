[{"title": "Moderating effects of self-defined sexual orientation on the relation between social factors and depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation among French young adults", "abstract": "Purpose Disparities in mental health across sexual orientation groups and among young adults have long been discussed. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the moderating effects of sexual orientation on the associations between social factors and depressive symptoms as well as suicidal ideation in young adults. Methods The study included 6,337 participants aged 18\u201325y in 2022 from the French EpiCov cohort. The outcome variables were depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Poisson regressions with robust error variance were performed to investigate the associations between social factors and outcomes according to sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, other, or not defining themselves according to their sexuality: sexual minority (SM); heterosexual or not wishing to answer: Not belonging to SM (NSM)). Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation was higher in the SM than in the NSM group. Regarding depressive symptoms, significant moderating effects of sexual orientation were observed for female vs male sex (NSM: adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) 1.58[1.28\u20131.95], SM: aPR 1.03[0.78\u20131.36]) and age category 22\u201325y vs 18-21y (NSM: aPR 1.32[1.05\u20131.67], SM: aPR 0.78[0.59\u20131.03]). Regarding suicidal ideation, significant moderating effect was observed for not being vs being in a relationship (NSM: aPR 1.55[1.14\u20132.12], SM: aPR 0.82[0.59\u20131.13]). Conclusion In this study conducted in 2022, well-known social risk factors of mental problems do not explain the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among young SM group. Further studies are needed to understand the specific challenges faced by these young people.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Depressive symptoms", "Epidemiology", "Sexual orientation", "Social factors", "Suicidal ideation", "Young adults"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-025-02951-y", "publicationDate": "2025-06-23"}, {"title": "The association of objectively and subjectively measured modifiable lifestyle factors with internalizing problems: the role of genetic confounding and shared method variance bias", "abstract": "Background Sleep duration and physical activity have been associated with internalizing problems. However, genetic confounding and measurement error may introduce bias. We assessed genetic confounding in the associations of modifiable lifestyle with internalizing problems using device-based and questionnaire assessments to estimate shared genetic risk across different assessments in adolescents. Methods In this preregistered study in the Adolescents Brain Cognitive Development cohort, we included European adolescents with both self-reported and device-based sleep duration ( N \u2009=\u20092283) and moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA, days/week, N \u2009=\u20092772). We used the Brief Problem Monitor to assess self-reported internalizing problem scores. Genetic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess genetic confounding by combining polygenic scores and molecular-based heritability of internalizing problems. Results Longer sleep duration was associated with lower internalizing problems using both self-reported (-0.15-SD, SE\u2009=\u20090.02-SD) and objective (-0.10-SD, SE\u2009=\u20090.02-SD) assessments. More frequent MVPA was associated with lower internalizing problems using both self-reported (-0.09-SD, SE\u2009=\u20090.02-SD) and device-based (-0.06-SD, SE\u2009=\u20090.02-SD) assessments. Substantial genetic confounding (81%) was found between self-reported sleep duration and internalizing problems, predominantly among boys. No clear evidence of genetic confounding was found in the associations of device-based sleep duration or either measures of MVPA with internalizing problems. Conclusion The observed negative relationship between reported child sleep duration and internalizing problems may be partly due to genetic confounding, particularly among boys. This genetic influence likely captured reporting measurement error of shared method variance. The impact of adolescent sleep duration on internalizing problems may be overestimated by self-reports, especially among boys, whereas associations of physical activity were not genetically confounded.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Genetic confounding", "Modifiable lifestyle", "Shared method variance", "Adolescent internalizing problems"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-025-02952-x", "publicationDate": "2025-06-23"}, {"title": "Psychological resilience trajectories after the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of lifestyle and psychosocial factors in a cohort at increased alzheimer\u2019s disease risk", "abstract": "Purpose This longitudinal cohort study evaluates whether lifestyle and psychosocial factors are associated with psychological resilience at two time points of COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we investigated the mediating role of perceived stress on these associations. Methods A total of 677 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults at increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Based on the Reliable Change Index (RCI), HADS trajectories were defined at two intervals: (1) pre-pandemic-confinement (follow-up =\u20092,28\u2009\u00b1\u20090,84 years); (2) confinement-post-confinement (follow-up =\u20091,49\u2009\u00b1\u20090,12 years). Then, 4 trajectory groups were defined: Psychological Resilience ( n \u2009=\u2009448, stable or improve at both intervals), Descending ( n \u2009=\u200984, stable/improve [interval 1]-worsen [interval 2]), Recovery ( n \u2009=\u200959, worsening [interval 1], improvement [interval 2] ) and Non-resilient ( n \u2009=\u200986, worsening at both intervals). Logistic regression models (LRM) were applied considering lifestyle (physical and leisure activities, sleep) and psychosocial factors (social relationships and emotional support) as predictors of psychological resilience trajectory (i.e., outcome) at both intervals. Finally, mediation analyses were carried out to test the effect of perceived stress on the relationships between the predictive factors and psychological resilience. Results Our finding showed that most participants followed a psychological resilient trajectory (66,1%). LRMs indicated that higher physical activity level, a greater number of social interactions and longer sleep duration were significantly associated with a psychological resilience trajectory both at confinement and at the 1.5 years follow-up. Lastly, the mediation analyses suggested that these factors influence psychological resilience through the mitigation of perceived stress.

Despite their heightened vulnerability, subgroups within this population demonstrated resilient outcomes throughout the pandemic. This study aims to identify predictors of long-term, sustained resilient outcomes among people with a history of mental disorder during the first two years of the pandemic. Methods In this international 2-year, 5-wave longitudinal online survey, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the PTSD Checklist DSM-5 were used for a proxy measure of psychological distress. As possible predictors of sustained resilient outcomes, we investigated socio-demographic characteristics, economic and housing status, pandemic-related issues, chronic diseases, social support, fear of contamination and personal values which were investigated respectively through the Oslo Social Support Scale, the Padua Inventory, and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Data were analysed with a Mover-Stayer Latent Transition Analysis model. Results Nine-hundred and forty-three participants with a mental disorder were included in the analysis. Variables associated with a higher chance of sustained resilient outcomes were older age, maintaining a job, and having more people in the household. In contrast, female gender, losing job, difficulty in meeting basic needs, higher fear of contamination, hedonism, less social support and loneliness resulted in a lower likelihood of presenting sustained resilient outcomes.

MPI outbreaks in school settings can lead to significant disruptions and psychological distress among students. This systematic review aimed to identify and characterize the factors contributing to the initiation and progression of MPI outbreaks in schools through an analysis of the existing literature. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in electronic databases, including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles published in English. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Moreover, grey literature search, hand searching, and backward/forward citation searching were performed. Data extraction was performed using a standardized form to collect information on outbreak characteristics, contributing factors, and symptom patterns. Results Nineteen studies were included. We identified 10 distinct factors associated with MPI outbreaks in schools, including (1) the spread of rumors and misinformation, (2) community pressure and persistent rumor dissemination, (3) lack of attention to mental disorders, (4) anxiety due to pseudo causation, (5) negative perception of the authorities, (6) the presence of psychological stressors, (7) media coverage and public anxiety, (8) physical proximity and perceived threat, (9) social media influence, and (10) psychological vulnerability. These factors were found to act as causal triggers or exacerbating elements, leading to the initiation and amplification of MPI outbreaks.

While such prediction models hold potential for enabling early interventions, few studies have applied ML approaches to this task, and those that have are heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, the clinical utility of these predictive models remains largely unexamined. Methods Data stemmed from CoLaus|PsyCoLaus, a population-based cohort study. In total, 1350 participants, age 35\u201366 years without lifetime MDD at baseline participated in the physical and psychiatric baseline and at least one psychiatric follow-up evaluation. Models based on logistic regression, elastic net, random forests, and XGBoost were trained using an extensive array of psychosocial, environmental, biological, and genetic predictors. Discriminative performance, calibration, clinical utility, and individual predictor contributions were assessed using nested cross-validation. Results Discriminative performance was comparable between models (areas under the precision-recall curve between 0.36 and 0.38; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.65 and 0.68). Decision curve analysis suggested clinical utility of logistic regression, elastic net, and random forests for threshold probabilities between 10% and 40%. Across all models, neuroticism, sex, and age were the most important predictors. Conclusions Although the prediction models achieved discriminative performance levels above chance, further refinement is necessary. The addition of biological and genetic predictors did not elevate performance markedly.

The review also seeks to evaluate coping strategies used by affected workers, as well as potential interventions to mitigate and prevent these mental health effects. Method A literature search was conducted in June 2024 in databases such as PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science, using a combination of keywords about climate change, mental health or illness, and vulnerable industries. Results A predominance of accessed literature was related to the agricultural industry, with a minority pertaining to the aquaculture, construction and aviation industries. They suggest an increased vulnerability of workers to mental health-related problems, including increased depression, anxiety, psychological distress and suicidality in response to stressors such as increased temperatures and prolonged drought conditions. Besides socioeconomic effects resulting from reduced productivity, climate-related stressors may contribute to increased uncertainty, isolation, a perceived lack of control, and challenges to their sense of identity. Coping methods varied and influenced outcomes of mental wellbeing, with community wellbeing and social connectedness in the agricultural setting being observed to have beneficial effects on levels of psychological distress. Interventions that promoted mental health literacy, the availability of mental health first aid, social cohesion, and adaptability to climate stressors were deemed helpful.

The goal of this research was to understand the relationship between WASH insecurity and psychological wellbeing in one community in Juba, South Sudan, using a participatory approach with community members. We aimed to: (1) explore the kind of WASH insecurity experienced in South Sudan; and (2) hear how community members understood the relationship between these insecurities and their psychological wellbeing. Methods A total of 56 adults from the community of Rejah, South Sudan, participated in this study. We used concept mapping to develop a conceptual framework for how community members viewed the relationship between WASH insecurity and psychological wellbeing. Participants engaged in three rounds of data collection that included brainstorming ideas, sorting ideas into meaningful groups, and providing feedback.

Methods Analyzing data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System for individuals newly diagnosed with Cluster B PD (\u2265\u200914 years) between 2002 and 2018 and under the provincial public drug plan, we calculated yearly and monthly proportions of individuals exposed to psychotropic medications during the year before and after their diagnosis by sex and age. Robust Poisson regression models assessed the association between sex and exposure to psychotropic medications after the diagnosis of Cluster B PD. Results Among 87,778 individuals with a first Cluster B PD diagnosis (mean age: 44.5 years; 57.5% women), the proportion of users increased post-diagnosis. Notably, after diagnosis, females were more likely to receive psychiatric medications (between 78.9% and 83.7% during the study period vs. 72.8% and 76.8%).

The current study aimed to address these gaps in the literature using a novel social network tool in combination with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and clinical ratings of negative symptoms. Methods Participants included 40 outpatients diagnosed with SZ and 35 demographically matched healthy controls (CN) who completed the sociogram, Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS), and 7 days of EMA surveys assessing anhedonia, avolition, and asociality. ANOVAs examined group differences in social network characteristics. Correlations examined associations between social network characteristics and negative symptoms measured via the BNSS and EMA.

This study examined whether cannabis legalization led to changes in acute care utilization among patients with schizophrenia. Method Using linked health administrative data, we included adult patients with schizophrenia in Ontario from October 2015 to May 2021 ( n \u2009=\u2009121,061). We examined the differences in cannabis, psychosis, and mental health-related emergency department (ED) visits over three periods: pre-legalization, legalization of flowers and herbs (phase 1), and legalization of edibles, extracts, and topicals (phase 2) using interrupted time-series methods. Results Our study found that phase 1 was associated with decreases in cannabis-related, mental health-related, and cannabis\u2009+\u2009psychosis-related ED visits among the patients with schizophrenia. Notably, an immediate 25.8% (95% CI 13.8\u201337.6%) decrease in cannabis-related ED visits was observed in men, and an immediate 18.5% decrease in mental health-related ED visits (95% CI 6.0\u201331.2%) in women. These decreases were also shown in the comparative ITS models, demonstrating that the changes observed were distinct from trends in the general population. However, phase 2 was not associated with any significant changes. Conclusions Despite higher baseline rates of acute care utilization among patients with schizophrenia, cannabis legalization was associated with significant reductions, particularly during phase 1.

This study examined the mediating effect of self-stigma on the relationship between community participation and personal recovery experiences and quality of life among PSMIs. Methods Structural equation modeling and mediation analyses were conducted based on a community sample of 315 PSMIs in Beijing, China, who were surveyed using the Community Participation Domains Measure, Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness, Recovery Assessment Scale, Quality of Life Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Most were in their middle age. About half were married, and half were females. Most participants got disability certificates.

We investigated factors associated with FEP in rural/urban settings and whether there are rural/urban differences in DUP and the mode (speed) of onset of psychosis. Methods We used the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust Research Database (CPFTRD) to identify all persons presenting to an early intervention for psychosis service with FEP between 2013 and 2015. We performed descriptive statistics and multivariable linear and multinomial regression to assess the relationships between the study outcomes and the independent variables. Results One hundred and fifty-five FEP patients were identified, with a mean age of 23.4 (SD, 5.3) years. The median DUP was 129.0 (IQR: 27.5\u2013524.0) days. In rural areas, FEP patients were more likely to be employed and live with family than those in urban areas.

Despite the high burden of the problem, evidence on its prevalence and contributing factors remains scarce in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of cognitive impairment among individuals with mood disorders. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted at Gedeo Zone public hospitals. A systematic sampling technique was used to select a total of 422 individuals receiving care for mood disorders. The outcome variable was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The data were entered into Epi Data version 4.2 and analyzed using STATA version 17. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with cognitive impairment. The presence of an association was examined with an adjusted odd ratio with a 95% confidence interval and variables with P values less than 0.05 were considered a statistically significant association.

Methods This secondary data analysis draws on data from six cross-sectional surveys (2000, 2005, 2010, 2014, 2017 and 2021) from the Health Barometer ran by Public Health France which included representative samples of the general population of metropolitan France. The current study sample included retired older adults aged 65 to 75 years across all surveys ( n \u2009=\u200918,120). Prevalence differences and ratios between waves with corresponding 95% CI were reported. Analyses were stratified by sex. Multivariable analyses were also carried out to ascertain the independent association between sex, living alone, education, income level, and region of residence urbanicity in relation to the presence of a lifetime suicide attempt. Analyses were weighted according to sampling weights based on the probability of inclusion in the study to ensure that the sample was representative of the French general population. Results There has been an increase in lifetime suicide attempts among retired older adults over the past two decades, with women consistently reporting a higher prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts than men over all time periods.

While a body of workplace loneliness research is emerging, the degree to which existing definitions of the phenomenon reflect workers\u2019 experiences has not been investigated. This study aims to develop an evidence-based conceptualisation of workplace loneliness that can inform future research and interventions aiming to improve workers\u2019 mental health and wellbeing. Methods Semi-structured interviews exploring experiences of social connection, loneliness and work were conducted with a diverse sample of 31 UK-based workers. The interviews were supplemented with a social mapping task. Interview data were analysed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis. Social maps were analysed using a thematic analysis approach informed by a visual semiology framework. Results Three themes were identified, in which loneliness was conceptualised as disconnection from (1) colleagues, (2) one\u2019s organisation, and (3) society. Across each theme, disconnection and loneliness were experienced as an unfulfilled desire to feel that one\u2019s authentic self was understood, valued or belonged as a result of one\u2019s work or occupation. Conclusions Workplace loneliness comprises not only dissatisfaction with interpersonal relationships at work, but also a sense of disconnection from larger social groups and structures, particularly one\u2019s employing organisation and society as a whole.

A cohort of Canadian adults ( n \u2009=\u200919,436,790) within 288 CDs were followed from May 2006 to December 2019. Multilevel Cox-proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the association between income inequality and time to deaths attributed to suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol. Results In models adjusted for confounders, income inequality was associated with time to death due to alcohol (HR\u2009=\u20091.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.25), drug overdose (HR\u2009=\u20091.19; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.33), and deaths of despair (HR\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.11).

As this can be a marker of the onset of mental disorders, we aimed to investigate whether attending university was associated with health service use for a mental health problem by age 24. Methods We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The analytic sample comprised of 2,649 individuals with data on university attendance reported approximately between ages 25 and 26, and health service use for a mental health problem reported around age 24. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between university attendance and health service use, employing confounder adjustment, multiple imputation and propensity score matching to assess the robustness of associations. The study was reported using STROBE guidelines. Results University attendees were less likely to report having used services for mental health problems by 24 years compared to non-university attendees (6.5% vs. 11.4%, odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.54[95%CI\u2009=\u20090.40;0.72], p \u2009<\u20090.001).

Studies have suggested an association between depressive symptoms and fall risk, but the mechanism of action is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between depressive symptoms and the risk of falls and severe falls, and to examine whether activities of daily living (ADL) impairment mediates this relationship. Methods This study included 12,440 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and 6,627 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D). Falls were defined as any fall experienced since the last follow-up. Severe falls were defined as falls that required medical treatment. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of depressive symptoms and ADL impairment with the risk of falls/severe falls. Further, we analyzed the mediating role of ADL impairment between depressive symptoms and falls/severe falls. Results The proportions of depressive symptoms in the CHARLS and ELSA longitudinal studies were 25.6% and 11.7%, respectively. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with falls in both longitudinal studies: the OR was 1.78 (95% CI: 1.62, 1.96) for CHARLS and 1.85 (95% CI: 1.57, 2.18) for ELSA. The association between depressive symptoms and severe falls was also significant, with an OR of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.41, 1.85) for CHARLS and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.37, 2.22) for ELSA. The association of depressive symptoms with falls and severe falls remained significant after controlling for ADL impairment. In addition, ADL impairment was significantly associated with fall risk, with ORs of 1.66 (95% CI: 1.49, 1.85) for CHARLS and 2.32 (95% CI: 2.01, 2.68) for ELSA; The association between ADL impairment and severe falls was also significant, with ORs of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.87) for CHARLS and 1.75 (95% CI: 1.40, 2.18) for ELSA. Mediation analysis revealed significant mediating effects of ADL impairment in the effect of depressive symptoms on the risk of falls and severe falls, with mediation effects all exceeding 20%, ranging from 22.2 to 27.3%. Conclusions This study revealed the key role of depressive symptoms and ADL impairment in the risk of falls/severe falls in middle-aged and older adults, and highlighted the mediating role of ADL impairment between depressive symptoms and falls/severe falls. In addition, fall risk in the UK was more affected by depressive symptoms than in China.

Results We included 22 studies. The estimated prevalence of severe loneliness was 27.1% (95% CI: 23.7\u201330.4%). The estimated prevalence of moderate loneliness equalled 32.1% (95% CI: 15.8\u201348.4%). Moreover, the estimated prevalence of social isolation was 33.6% (95% CI: 28.9\u201338.2%). There was heterogeneity between the studies. Egger tests suggest the absence of potential publication bias. Meta-regressions showed that the heterogeneity could neither be attributed to the assessment of loneliness nor to the continent where the study was conducted. Conclusion Loneliness and social isolation are important problems in the oldest old. In this age group, studies are required, in particular from regions outside Europe. Additionally, longitudinal studies are required to investigate the determinants of loneliness and social isolation amongst individuals aged 80\u00a0years and over.

The long-term responses to traumatic events are variable and can be classified into distinct PTSS trajectories. In this prospective study, we evaluated PTSS trajectories among combat veterans during the initial year after discharge from military service. Subsequently, we analyzed how combat exposure and PMIEs contributed to these trajectories. Methods Our study encompassed 374 combat veterans who participated in a five-year prospective study, with four waves of measurements, T1 - one year before enlistment, T2 - one month prior to discharge from military service (July 2021), and then again at six months (T3 - February 2022) and twelve months after discharge (T4, July-August 2022) .

Methods Using four-wave data (2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (N = 65455), APC effects were quantified based on the hierarchical APC model. The 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Results Depressive symptoms increased during late life and stabilized after reaching an advanced age. After further adjusting for individual characteristics, depressive symptoms exhibited a negative trend with advancing age. The mean levels of depressive symptoms remained stable during the study period. Depressive symptoms varied significantly across cohorts, with those born in 1949\u20131951 having the most severe depressive symptoms. Significant life-course and cohort variations existed in the gender gaps in depressive symptoms. Although women had higher mean scores on the CES-D-10 scale throughout the life course, the gender gaps in depressive symptoms gradually narrowed with age, as depressive symptoms decreased more rapidly among women. A widening trend in gender gaps in depressive symptoms was found among those born after the mid-1950s, mainly driven by a notable decline in depressive symptoms among men Conclusions The convergence of living conditions between genders in late life, as a result of traditional Chinese culture, may have narrowed the gender gap in depressive symptoms.

Lower and higher birth weight and prenatal famine exposure were associated with higher dementia risk. The studies on season of birth, digit ratio, prenatal influenza pandemic exposure, parental age and birth order showed inconsistent results and were hampered by relatively high risk of bias.

Methods Based on the longitudinal tracking data of CLHLS (2008\u20132018), latent growth curve model (LGCM) was used to describe the trajectory of loneliness among older adults. Panel regression was used to analyze the impact of unmet community service demands on loneliness, and latent classification analysis (LCA) was used to classify the older adults and analyze the differences in loneliness among different types of older adults. Results A total of 1445 older people participated in all four surveys, and 22.4% of them reported feeling lonely.

A significant association was observed between ACEs and dementia risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.35; 95% CI 1.20, 1.52; P \u2009=\u20090.00001) and mild cognitive impairment risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.28; 95% CI 0.63, 2.62; P \u2009=\u20090.49). A meta-analysis by type of adversity revealed significant results for the maltreatment subgroup(OR\u2009=\u20091.30; 95% CI 0.07-1.58; P \u2009=\u20090.007; I\u00b2 = 0%). Subgroup analysis based on the dementia definition revealed no between-subgroup difference ( P \u2009=\u20090.71) between tool-based and register/criteria-based subgroups. No possibility of Publication bias was observed upon inspection of the funnel plot. Conclusion Adverse childhood experiences may be associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, caution is warranted in interpreting these results due to the limited number of studies.

Lockdown experiences for college students varied. Local students normally returned home and had familial support while non-local students relied more on institutional support when quarantining in dormitories. The difference could profoundly impact their access to necessary material resources and emotional support, affecting their mental health. This study compared the psychological effects of the Shanghai Lockdown on local and non-local college students using an explanatory-sequential mixed methods design. Methods Quantitative analyses of data from 327 college students examined local and non-local students\u2019 mental health outcomes during the lockdown. Follow-up qualitative interviews ( N \u2009=\u200912) contextualized their sources of stress and group differences. Results Higher prevalences of probable anxiety (34.6%), depression (45.1%), and poor subjective mental well-being (65.4%) are found among non-local students compared to local students (23.7% anxiety, 29.4% depressive symptoms, and 47.9% poor well-being). Suicidal ideation was higher among local students (8.6% prevalence difference). Being a non-local college student was associated with increased odds of probable anxiety, depression, and poor well-being. Interviews identified group differences such that non-local students received more school support (i.e., food and financial) and perceived emotional support but faced poorer quarantine living environments compared to local peers.

ASD was introduced as a potential early indicator to identify those at higher risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), however, PTSD can occur in some individuals even without prior ASD. Assessing ASD post-trauma can assist in identifying those who would most benefit from intervention to prevent later PTSD, yet the predictive power of ASD varies across studies, with intensity of ASD symptoms and subthreshold PTSD often less considered. Methods A prospective cohort study on 426 health workers exposed to the Beirut Port Blast assessed DSM-5 ASD and symptom intensity using self-report questionnaire at two distinct time points: 9\u201315 and 21\u201327 days post blast. DSM-5 PTSD was assessed afterwards at 6\u20137 months via self-report questionnaire post-exposure. Probit models predicted full and subthreshold PTSD. Results Using ASD diagnosis alone, the sensitivity 9\u201315 days after trauma was better than 21\u201327 days after trauma (75.68% vs. 58.06%); when stratified by intensity, however, sensitivity increased from 41.66% among those with low intensity to 92% among those with high intensity.

To address this evidence gap, we investigated the associations between microaggressions and poor mental health (depression; anxiety; non-suicidal self-harm [NSSH]; suicidal thoughts; suicide attempt) amongst trans people. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 787 trans adults in the UK, measuring mental health and exposure to microaggressions using the Gender Identity Microaggressions Scale (GIMS). Using univariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression models we tested for an association of microaggressions with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), lifetime NSSH, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and lifetime suicide attempt. Results Of the 787 participants, 574 (73%) provided complete data. Microaggressions were a common experience, affecting 97.6% of participants over their lifetime. In adjusted analyses, using sociodemographic and clinical variables, increased microaggression scores were associated with increased depressive symptoms (adjusted coefficient: 1.86 (95%CI\u2009=\u20091.35 to 2.36)), anxiety symptoms (adjusted coefficient: 1.57 (95%CI\u2009=\u20091.09 \u20132.05)) and with increased odds of NSSH (Odds Ratio [OR]_ adj 1.83 (95%CI\u2009=\u20091.45 \u20132.30)), suicidal thoughts (OR_adj 2.18, (95%CI\u2009=\u20091.52 \u20133.13)), and suicide attempt (OR_adj, 1.59, (95%CI\u2009=\u20091.32 \u20131.92)).

Results There were no differences in lifetime interpersonal traumas between the clinical and non-clinical groups, with the latter reporting slightly more than controls. The clinical group experienced more lifetime perceived discrimination than the other groups. No differences emerged in impact and powerlessness at the time of victimisation; however, the clinical group reported lower positive social support and higher current impact and powerlessness for both types of victimisation.

A cluster-RCT of the ReCoN intervention", "abstract": "Purpose Internationally, policies and legal changes seek to reduce the use of involuntary psychiatric admissions. Usually directed towards specialist services, these initiatives show little sustained progress. We tested whether an intervention at the level of primary mental health services has potential to reduce the use of involuntary admissions. Methods We conducted a two-arm cluster-RCT following Zelen\u2019s design (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03989765). Each cluster included the primary mental health service and their local collaborators in mid-sized Norwegian municipalities with rates of involuntary admissions above the national average. Five clusters were randomised to co-create and implement a comprehensive intervention. These could not be blinded, but the five control clusters were. Our primary hypothesis was that rates of involuntary admissions would be lower in the intervention arm when comparing change over time between arms, and that this would sustain. Secondary hypotheses were that rates of referrals for involuntary admissions and rates of referrals confirmed for involuntary status after the second statutory assessment, would be lower in the intervention arm. Results Data obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry included all events in the study period. The difference between trial arms in changes of rates of involuntary admissions from baseline to the intervention period was 6.8 (95% CI 1.8 to 11.7; effect size (EC) 2.7), and reduced to 3.0 (95% CI -3.8 to 9.7; ES 0.9) between baseline and the post-intervention period. The difference between arms regarding changes in referral rates between the baseline and intervention period was 1.7 (95% CI -4.6 to 8.1; ES 0.5), and for changes in the rate of referrals resulting in involuntary status it was 1.3 (95% CI -3.4 to 6.0; ES 0.8).

The meta-regression analysis showed that the prevalence of probably postpartum depression did not change depending on the geographical region where the studies were performed, the time of data collection and the cut-off point of the EPDS. However, the studies reported many factors related to women, their infants and families that affected the prevalence of probably postpartum depression. Outcomes This meta-analysis revealed that the prevalence of probably postpartum depression was very high, increased during the pandemic and was affected by many risk factors.

Method A total of 746 participants (ages 21\u201351), including 377 men (50.5%), were recruited through a large Israeli online platform. Participants completed self-report demographic data and questionnaires assessing NES, sleep disturbances, eating patterns, and psychopathology. Results The prevalence of NES (night eating questionnaire/NEQ: score\u2009>\u200925, score\u2009>\u200921) was 8.8% and 18.2%, respectively. No significant differences in NES prevalence were found between genders or age groups in most of the variables.

Comparing articles over the entire timespan (T1-T3), a higher proportion of Israeli tabloid articles included putatively harmful content, such as mentioning suicide means (Israel: 65.3% vs. Canada 25.3%, \u03c7^2(1)\u2009=\u200948.4, p \u2009<\u20090.001), and a higher proportion of Canadian broadsheet articles included putatively protective content, such as providing information on intervention (Israel: 2.0% vs. Canada 27.3%, \u03c7^2(1)\u2009=\u200938.5, p \u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusion Media engagement appeared to confer benefits in both countries and publication formats. A higher proportion of Canadian articles adhered to several specific recommendations.

Loneliness was assessed via a single-item measure, while resilience was estimated using the Resilience Scale for Adolescents. Anxiety and depression outcomes at the 11-year follow-up were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to analyze the associations. Moreover, interaction effects were evaluated using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Results Loneliness during adolescence independently predicted anxiety and depression in young adulthood. Adolescents experiencing both loneliness and low resilience showed notably higher risks compared to other groups (highly resilient adolescents without loneliness [reference], highly resilient adolescents with loneliness, and adolescents with low resilience and low loneliness). The combined effect of loneliness and low resilience exhibited a synergistic interaction on the additive scale, although it was not statistically significant (RERI 0.13, 95% CI -2.39-2.65).

Primary outcomes of interest are the following indicators of mental health care services use: first access to any mental health care service (MHCS), total number of accesses to MHCS, the consumption of psychiatric drugs, the number of psychiatric or psychological outpatient visits, the number of residential or day care days spent in psychiatric facilities, the number of emergency department (ED) admissions, and inpatient admissions to hospitals. Results Initial findings show that incident MHCS users were 3.2% of the population of the Bergamo Local Health Authority (LHA), 3.5% of the Rome 2 LHA, and 4.4% of the Tuscany Region. The overall crude incidence rate of access to mental health care was 3.3% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 2.6% during the pandemic. Prescriptions for a mental disorder (57.2%) and ED admissions (25.1%) were the main reasons for enrollment. Compared to the general population, people with mental health conditions were older and more often female. The distribution of the incident users by deprivation index overlapped that of the population. Immigrants were younger, socioeconomically more deprived, and more often entered the study for an ED admission. Conclusion This first CoMeH cohort study focused on the impact of the pandemic through the evaluation of hospitalizations, emergency department accesses, outpatient visits, residential and day care service use, and drug prescriptions. We also evaluated socioeconomic inequalities through the use of census-based deprivation index and migration status.

Methods Selective review of literature and conceptual synthesis. Results \u201cThe social\u201d in psychiatry stands for the structures and dynamics of groups of people interacting on multiple scales from the intimate sphere of couple and family to neighbourhoods, communities, societies, nations, and transnational or global networks. These interactions create social contexts, niches, forms of belonging, identities, institutions, and larger systems that influence the causes, expression, course, and outcome of mental disorders. Characterizing these systems requires theory that considers the ways in which social systems constitute dynamical systems that configure material, energetic, and informational flows that give rise to human experience. Unpacking the health consequences of these local and extended systems requires an interdisciplinary approach that considers: (1) the social psychological, psychophysiological, and sociophysiological processes that mediate the impact of the environment on body, mind, and person; (2) the interactional dynamics of social systems that give rise to structural adversity and inequity as well as resilience; and (3) the recursive effects of self-understanding, agency and subjectivity.

Participants allocated to the intervention were asked to do at least one act of kindness per week within a four-week period. The primary outcome was loneliness and secondary outcomes included measures of social isolation, mental health, and neighbourhood social cohesion. Results There was a significant, albeit small, intervention effect after four weeks for reduced loneliness in the USA and the UK, but not for Australia. Relative to controls, KIND challenge participants also showed significantly reduced social isolation and social anxiety in the USA, and reduced stress in Australia. There was also reduced neighbourhood conflict in the USA, increased number of neighbourhood contacts in the USA and Australia, greater neighbourhood stability and feelings of neighbourhood importance in the UK, and better neighbourhood social relationships in Australia.

In this multicenter trial the effectiveness of a community mental health intervention (acronym: GBV) added to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone was investigated. Methods In a randomized controlled multicenter trial with twelve sites spread across Germany, people living with SMI aged 18\u201382 years were investigated over 24 months. The trial was conducted from 2020 to 2023, a time period affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The intervention was delivered by multiprofessional GBV teams based on the Functional Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) program and was supplemented by strategies that increase the degree of self-determination. The primary outcome was measured by the Assessment of Empowerment in Patients with Affective and Schizophrenic Disorders (EPAS). Difference in difference (DiD) effect sizes were estimated on an intention-to-treat basis. Results A total of 929 persons with SMI were randomly assigned to the GBV plus TAU intervention ( n \u2009=\u2009470) or to TAU alone ( n \u2009=\u2009459). The dropout rate over 24 months amounted to 28%. DiD effect sizes over 24 months indicate significant treatment effects for empowerment (d\u2009=\u20090.27; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.14 0.40).

However, the association of the comorbidity of heavy alcohol consumption and depression on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality remains unclear in the U.S. population. Aim The objective of our study was to analyze the risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in participants who have heavy alcohol consumption alone, depression alone, or both, by conducting a prospective cohort study with a sample in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Method For this cohort study, we included 11,590 U.S. adults aged\u2009\u2265\u200920 years from a nationally representative sample. Data on depression and alcohol consumption were extracted from the NHANES conducted between 2005 and 2018, and mortality information was obtained from the NHANES Linked Mortality File through December 31, 2019. Drinking and depression were classified into four groups: only heavy alcohol consumption, only depression, both present, and neither present. By adjusting for confounding factors, we applied the Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the risk of all-cause mortality associated with alcohol consumption and depressive states, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and other causes. The log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis were applied to investigate differences in survival probabilities. Additionally, we examined the correlation between heavy alcohol consumption and depression by assessing additive interaction using the synergy index (SI), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Results The adjusted HR (aHR) for all-cause mortality, as well as mortality due to CVD, cancer, and other causes, were highest among individuals with comorbid heavy alcohol consumption and depression (HR 2.68[95%CI 1.84,3.91]; 2.64 [95%CI 1.27, 5.48]; 2.55 [95%CI 1.22,5.35]; and 2.78[95%CI 1.64, 4.71]). However, the results of additive and multiplicative interactions indicated that the synergistic effect of heavy alcohol consumption and depression on all-cause and cause-specific mortality did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Our findings confirmed that heavy alcohol consumption or depression was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and other-cause mortality. Although the synergistic effect of comorbid heavy alcohol consumption and depression on all-cause and cause-specific mortality did not reach statistical significance, the comorbidity of heavy alcohol consumption and depression was associated with the highest risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

A generalized estimating equation model was used to analyze the impact of changes in family relationships on suicidal ideation in people with physical disabilities. Results Individuals with physical disabilities whose family relationships declined were 1.63 times more likely to have suicidal ideation (95% CI 1.22\u20132.19) compared to those with consistently good family relationship. Among the subfactors of family relationships, family problem-solving ability showed the strongest association with suicidal ideation when it deteriorated (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.74). Individuals with consistently poor family relationships were 1.78 times more likely to have suicidal ideation alone (95% CI 1.33\u20132.38) and 2.29 times more likely to have both suicidal ideation and attempts (95% CI 0.89\u20135.93).

Despite extensive research, areas such as time perception and positivity remain underexplored, and machine learning has not yet been adequately utilised. This study aims to address these gaps by examining sex differences in a sample of Italian patients with SSD using a data-driven approach. Methods As part of the DiAPAson project, 619 Italian patients with SSD (198 females; 421 males) were assessed using standardised clinical tools. Data on socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, symptom severity, functioning, positivity, quality of life (QoL), and time perspective were collected. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was used to define data-driven clusters. A leave-one-group-out validation was performed. Results Males were more likely to be single (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and less educated (p\u2009=\u20090.006), while females smoked more tobacco (p\u2009=\u20090.011). Males were more frequently prescribed antipsychotics (p\u2009=\u20090.022) and exhibited more severe psychiatric (p\u2009=\u20090.004) and negative symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.013). They also had a less negative perception of past events (p\u2009=\u20090.047) and a better view of their psychological condition (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Females showed better interpersonal functioning (p\u2009=\u20090.008). PCA and GMM revealed two main clusters with significant sex differences (p\u2009=\u20090.027). Conclusion This study identifies sex differences in SSD, suggesting tailored treatments such as enhancing interpersonal skills for females and maintaining positive self-assessment for males. Using machine learning, we highlight distinct SSD phenotypes, emphasising the need for sex-specific interventions to improve outcomes and QoL.

We aimed to investigate prevalence, course, correlates, comorbidity, impairment, and treatment of ASAD in Saudi Arabia. Methods The study analyzed a subset of 1793 participants from the Saudi National Mental Health Survey; a nationally representative household sample of Saudi citizens. The survey used the CIDI 3.0 to produce prevalence estimates of ASAD and other common DSM-IV mental disorders. Cross tabulations, survival analysis and logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results The lifetime and 12-month prevalence of ASAD were 7.6% and 3.8%, respectively. Over half (51.7%) of participants with lifetime ASAD had onset in adulthood, and 50.5% of those with lifetime ASAD also had 12-month ASAD. Lifetime ASAD was significantly associated with being female (OR\u2009=\u20092.1), not being married (ORs\u2009=\u20092.2\u20133.2), having low education (OR\u2009=\u20090.4), and maladaptive family functioning (ORs\u2009=\u20093.6\u20136.7). Primary lifetime ASAD was a strong predictor of subsequent other mental disorders (ORs\u2009=\u20091.1\u20136.5). Further, mood, impulse, and substance use disorders were significantly associated with subsequent first onset of ASAD (ORs\u2009=\u20092.15-3.0). ASAD was severely impairing in the presence (59.0%) or absence (56.2%) of 12-month comorbidity. Among those with lifetime ASAD, only 26.1% reported treatment for a mental health condition.

Results Higher levels of combat exposure and baseline PTSD symptoms predicted elevated PTSD symptoms at 10-year follow-up. Perceived social support moderated these effects, such that the impacts of baseline symptoms and combat exposure were attenuated for Veterans with high levels of perceived support. However, buffering effects were less evident at higher levels of combat exposure and were not significant at very high levels of baseline PTSD symptoms.

To address this, we explored the association between components of social performance and PLEs in adolescents aged 13\u201318 using a novel virtual reality (VR) paradigm for real-time assessment. Methods Adolescents ( N \u2009=\u2009146) aged 13\u201318 were recruited as part of a larger cohort study conducted by the same research group (YVORI_PRO) and invited to participate via the following criteria: those reporting highly indicative positive PLEs (HIP, N \u2009=\u200988) and those reporting no or less indicative PLEs (no-HIP, N \u2009=\u200958). Self-report, behavioural and physiological components of social performance were collected using a portable VR headset and a medical wristband. Participants entered a virtual recreational area with three levels of social ambiguity and were encouraged to interact with avatars. MANOVA was performed to check for overall group differences and repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to examine the effects of group and level of ambiguity, as well as their interaction, on daily social performance. Results During virtual social interactions, adolescents with HIP reported higher levels of anxiety, fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and avoidance than the no-HIP group. No significant difference between groups was found for self-confidence. With increasing social ambiguity in VR, anxiety, FNE and avoidance increased in both groups, while self-confidence decreased. No significant group differences were found in behavioural or physiological components of social performance. Interpersonal distance and pulse rate increased significantly with increasing level of ambiguity, but pulse rate variability and skin conductance did not. Conclusion The results suggest that adolescents with HIP may present specific difficulties related to social performance, which may carry additional psychosis risk.

Furthermore, the fragmented nature of care provision may also contribute to unmet needs. Therefore, we assessed the needs of service users with SUD and identified their need profiles and their determinants. We aimed to identify possible gaps in care that were likely to hamper recovery pathways and to examine whether the care supply was tailored to users\u2019 needs. Methods A convenience sample of 562 service users with SUD drawn from diverse mental health services in Belgium, including specialised services for SUD, were assessed using the Camberwell Assessment of Needs\u2013 Short Appraisal Schedule (Patient version). Additional indicators, including social integration, substance use behaviours, service utilisation, and well-being, were also collected. A Latent Class Analysis was performed to identify need profiles. Results Three classes of need profiles were identified. The largest class comprised 40% of the sample and included individuals with few needs. The second class encompassed 35% of the sample and represented those whose needs were mainly met by professionals. The third class, accounting for 25% of the sample, included individuals with many unmet needs. Across classes, company, intimate relationships, and sexual expression were the most reported unmet needs. Poor social integration and subjective well-being were associated with more needs, either met or unmet. Females (OR\u2009=\u20092.76, p \u2009=\u20090.025), and those using social services (OR\u2009=\u20092.54, p \u2009=\u20090.022), homecare and outreach services (OR\u2009=\u20093.683, p \u2009=\u20090.003) were more likely to report met needs. In contrast, using multiple substances was associated with unmet needs (OR\u2009=\u20093.87, p \u2009=\u20090.008). There was no significant association between need profiles and the use of specialised services for SUD. Conclusion Needs of people with SUD go beyond substance use and encompass social relationships.

Methods We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 84,755 adults (ages\u2009\u2265\u200918) in Chilean SUD treatment during 2010\u20132019, creating a comparable sample of 11,226 pairs in ambulatory and residential treatment through cardinality matching. We used a nine-state multistate model, stratifying readmissions by baseline treatment outcome (i.e., completion vs. noncompletion) from admission to the third readmission. We estimated transition probabilities and lengths of stay in states at three-month, one-year, three-year, and five-year follow-ups. Sensitivity analyses tested different model specifications and estimated E-values. Results Patients in residential settings (vs. ambulatory) had greater treatment completion probabilities (difference at three months; 3.4% [95% CI: 2.9%, 3.9%]), and longer treatment retention (e.g., 1.6 days longer at three months, 95% CI: 0.8, 2.3). Patients in residential vs. ambulatory settings had higher first readmission probabilities regardless of baseline treatment outcome (e.g., three-month difference: 5.7% if completed baseline [95% CI: 4.4%, 7.0%] and 8.0% if did not complete baseline [95% CI: 6.7, 9.3%]). Third readmission probabilities were higher only among patients in residential settings with an incomplete baseline treatment (at least 3.7%; 95% CI: 0.2%, 7.3% at 1-year).

Methods A cohort design was applied to national register data on all individuals aged 10\u2009+\u2009years living in Denmark during 2000\u20132021. DSH episodes were identified in somatic and psychiatric hospital data. Sex- and age-specific incidence rates (IR) were calculated by calendar years. Using joinpoint regression analyses, segments of change and their annual percent change (APC) were identified. Results The highest DSH rates were observed for males and females aged 19\u201324 years with IRs of 146.8 (95% CI 142.9\u2013150.7) and 378.6 (95% CI 372.1\u2013385.0) per 100,000 person-years, respectively.

Results There was strong evidence that ARMS patients accessing EIP were younger and were less likely to have a minority ethnic status than FEP patients. In terms of PtC, ARMS patients had fewer numbers of contacts, were less likely to be referred via the acute services, less likely to be involuntarily admitted and had reduced family involvement in their help-seeking.

Methods This retrospective observational study examines age-period-cohort trends of (combined and cause-specific) substance poisoning, alcohol-related disease, and suicide deaths among Australians aged \u226515-years that occurred between 1980 and 2019 and compares trends between males and females. Results Combined mortality rates were initially (1980\u20131999) relatively stable, reflecting a reduction in alcohol-related disease deaths offset by an increase in substance poisoning deaths. A decline (2000\u20132006) and subsequent increase (2007\u20132019) in combined rates were primarily attributable to corresponding changes in both substance poisoning and suicide deaths among males.

Methods Data from Youth Risk Behavior Surveys conducted in Ningbo in 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022 were used for the study. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select respondents aged 12 to 19 years who participated in each survey.

This systematic review addressed this by estimating the global prevalence of common mental health disorders, namely anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in paramedic students internationally. Methods A systematic search of six databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and medRxiv, was conducted to identify studies relating to mental health among paramedicine students. The search encompassed studies from inception until February 2023. To be considered for inclusion in the review, the studies had to report prevalence data on at least one symptom of anxiety, depression, or PTSD in paramedicine students, using quantitative validated scales. The quality of the studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist, which is a specific methodological tool for assessing prevalence studies. Subgroup analyses were not conducted due to insufficient data. Results 1638 articles were identified from the searches, and 193 full texts were screened, resulting in 13 papers for the systematic review and meta-analysis.

However, the exact correlation between cholelithiasis and depression severity remains unclear. Methods First, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to validate previous research findings, utilizing separate datasets for major depressive disorder (MDD) and cholelithiasis. The MDD dataset (135,458 cases, 344,901 controls) came from a published GWAS, and cholelithiasis data (19,023 cases, 195,144 controls) were sourced from FinnGen. The primary analytical approach for the MR study was the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. Second, an observational study based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was conducted to explore the relationship between the severity of depression and cholelithiasis. 7071 participants were included in the observational study in total. Depression severity (no, mild, moderate, severe) was measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Weighted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed to assess the association between depression severity and cholelithiasis.

In the regression analysis, the low educational level of EM people (AOR\u2009=\u20094.27: 1.28\u201314.35), their parental (AOR\u2009=\u20095.53: 2.14\u201317.22), female sex (AOR\u2009=\u20091.58: 1.07\u20132.33), and family low income (AOR\u2009=\u20092.74: 1.00\u20137.84), and being a housewife (AOR\u2009=\u20091.71: 1.22\u20133.26) were identified as the most reliable predictors of EM. In the final analysis, after adjusting for the potential confounders, EM was associated with an increased risk of DSs (AOR\u2009=\u20091.60: 1.2\u20132.72). Conclusion Based on the results, EM is common and associated with DSs in this county. Our study provides preliminary findings to guide future studies, given that this issue has been neglected in previous investigations.

Promoting secure firearm storage practices is a major component of the Department of Defense\u2019s suicide prevention strategy, but perceptions about firearms being associated with suicide risk may impact such efforts. Purpose This study examined perceptions that (1) firearm ownership and (2) storage practices are associated with suicide risk and whether key sociopsychological factors (e.g., entrapment, threat perceptions, honor ideology) were associated with these beliefs in a sample of Active Duty (AD) enlisted Army personnel. We then examined if associations varied as a function of firearm ownership or a lifetime history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors (STBs). Methods Survey data about sociopsychological factors and ownership-suicide risk beliefs and storage-suicide risk beliefs were collected from 399 AD Army personnel. Multiple regression and multigroup path analyses were used. Results Greater intolerance of uncertainty and entrapment, and weaker honor ideology, were associated with greater ownership-suicide risk beliefs, whereas being a parent of a minor child was linked with weaker ownership-suicide risk beliefs. None of the variables examined were associated with storage-suicide risk beliefs. Participants with a lifetime history of STBs who had higher threat perceptions endorsed weaker ownership-suicide risk beliefs. Conclusions AD Army personnel may tend to believe that firearm ownership and storage practices are largely unrelated to suicide risk.

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study using data from the two editions of the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS in the Portuguese acronym) conducted in 2013 and 2019. Major depressive episodes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and classified in two ways: based on a cutoff point of \u2265\u20099 points on the scale and according to the diagnostic criteria of the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Diet quality was assessed using a diet quality score that considered the week consumption of seven food items. We used linear regression models to explore the association between major depressive episodes and diet quality score. Sensitivity analysis evaluating the association between major depressive episodes and each food item that composed the diet quality score was performed. Results In both 2013 and 2019, individuals with major depressive episodes had a diet quality score 0.20 standard deviations higher compared to their peers, indicating a worse diet quality, regardless of the criteria used to define exposure and the potential confounders. Sensitivity analysis revealed a lower prevalence of regular consumption of beans, vegetables, fruits, and milk, and a higher prevalence of regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets among individuals with major depressive episodes.

Sarcopenia was defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 and Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Social isolation was measured by the Steptoe Social Isolation Index for American and a 5-item scale for Chinese. Logistic regression models with inverse probability weighting were conducted to explore the effect of social isolation on sarcopenia risk.

Like other illnesses, FEP incidence is also influenced by environmental factors. It is necessary to attend to this age group with early interventions and to act on the environmental factors that the literature correlates with increased FEP incidence: socio-economic aspects, social adversity, bullying at school or cannabis use. In this context, identifying the areas of cities where FEP patients concentrate is important to perform early interventions.

However, evidence of PLEs in Latin American (LATAM) countries is still scarce, and there are no studies about PLEs in Chile. The main aim of this study is to describe the prevalence of PLEs in a nationally representative sample according to other\u00a0social determinants of health. Methods The last results of the Chilean National Health Survey (ENS 2016\u20132017) were analyzed. PLEs were obtained from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 3.0 and included in this survey. Other psychosocial variables (age, sex, educational level, financial stress, depressive symptoms, and urbanicity) were also included for further analysis. Exclusion criteria were (1)\u2009>\u2009\u2009=\u200965 and\u2009<\u200918\u00a0years old, and (2) previous diagnosis or treatment for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Methods Data were from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Our analytical sample comprised 4394 participants aged 49 to 78 from two birth cohorts born between 1937 and 1966: exposed cohort during adolescence (born between 1952 and 1966), and non-exposed cohort during adolescence (born between 1937 and 1951). We defined earthquake exposure as the exposure severity of the 1976 Great Tangshan Earthquake (GTE). We selected community environmental characteristics as our key moderators. A difference-in-differences (DID) method was employed to estimate the long-term impact of the GTE on later-life cognitive function.

Verbal learning was the cognitive function most related to social exclusion domains, and legal capacity was the exclusion domain that showed the strongest relationships with individual cognitive tests. Neurocognition uniquely contributed to housing, work activity, income, and educational attainment, whereas social cognition uniquely contributed to neighborhood deprivation, family and social contacts, and discrimination/stigma. Neurocognition explained more unique variance (11.5%) in social exclusion than social cognition (5.5%).

Descriptive and inferential statistics, including one-way ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression, were utilized for identifying the potential predictors of anxiety. Result This study found that 22.2% of reproductive-aged women in Nepal experience moderate to severe anxiety. The stepwise multiple regression revealed seven most influential factors, with depression (mild, moderate, severe) being the most influential predictor of anxiety, explaining 51.8% of the variance (R square change\u2009=\u20090.518; Sig. =<0.001).

During the same period, absolute inequalities in SRMH increased by 9.9% points (95% CI: 6.6, 12.9) for females compared to males, 11.4% points (95% CI: 4.6, 18.2) for Indigenous versus non-racialized youth, and 15.4% points (95% CI: 5.7, 25.1) for youth (aged 18\u201324) identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) compared to heterosexual. Conclusion The sustained deterioration in youth SRMH over the past decade and a half has been accompanied by widening inequalities across several dimensions important for health equity in Canada.

Having an online questionnaire assessing the fidelity of EIP services, completed by staff self-reports, and having evidence of reliability and validity, could fill that gap. We assess the reliability and validity of the Early Intervention for Psychosis Services Fidelity Questionnaire (EIPS-FQ), developed in Part I of this set of papers. Methods A convenience sample of 10 EIP teams in England was used. Two staff members completed online questionnaires assessing recent and past fidelity. An external rater completed the same questionnaire for the two time periods, using a random sample of patient medical records, program documentation, and interviews with staff. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess inter-rater reliability. Validity was assessed using Bland-Altman plots, absolute mean differences, and the ICC. Results The fidelity score measuring recent fidelity ranged from 54.2 to 82.7, out of a possible 100. The ICC assessing reliability of the fidelity score was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.0-0.81). The ICCs for the fidelity sub-category scores ranged from 0 to 0.76. Two sub-categories, comprehensive assessments and family involvement and intervention, had low ICCs, regardless of period examined. Conclusions This first attempt at validating the EIPS-FQ has demonstrated that the reliability of the EIPS-FQ is moderate/low, and therefore requires modification prior to use.

This study therefore aims at determining the prevalence and symptom severity of misophonia in a large and representative general population sample in Germany. Methods To examine the prevalence of misophonic sounds, misophonic reactions and misophonia severity, a cross-sectional population representative survey in Germany has been conducted.

Arab immigrants/refugees (AIR) may be at high risk for MH problems owing to various unique stressors, such as post-September/11 demonization. Despite the growing AIR population in Western countries, there is a lack of AIR-MH research in these nations. The CAN-HEAL study examined MH experiences and needs among AIR in Ontario, Canada. Methods This study employed a cooperative community-based participatory research and integrated knowledge translation approach. The study used photovoice, qualitative interviews and a questionnaire survey. Sixty socio-demographically diverse AIR adults partook in this study. The research was informed by the \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d framework and the \u201cyears since immigration effect\u201d (YSIE) theory.

Participants proposed other culturally-appropriate words including \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201cemotional state\u201d. The prevalence of poor mental well-being in the sample was alarming (55%). Of first-generation immigrant participants, 86.8% reported negative changes in MH since migration. The negative changes are not straightforward; they are complex and dynamic, and mainly related to micro/macro-aggression, cross-cultural pressures, dissatisfaction with the health and social care system, and poor living conditions. Intersections between different socio-demographic factors (e.g., gender, length of residency, income, parenthood, religion) amplified the negative changes in MH and exacerbated inequities.

In this review, we conducted content analysis to synthesize evidence to understand and compare the commonalities and discrepancies in conceptual elements that were incorporated within the definitions of different forms of restrictive care practices. Results A total of 95 studies that provided definitions for different forms of restrictive care practices [physical/mechanical restraint ( n \u2009=\u200972), seclusion ( n \u2009=\u200965) and chemical restraint ( n \u2009=\u200919)] were included in this review. Significant variations existed in the conceptual domains presented within the applied definitions of physical/mechanical restraint, seclusion, and chemical restraint.

However, longer-term trends remain unclear. This study aims to describe older adults' trajectories in SWB dimensions before, during, and after the pandemic spanning 2017\u20132022. Methods This study used piecewise growth curve analysis on a subsample of the Swiss Household Panel to investigate the population-average (n individuals = 3086; n = observations = 13,780) trajectories of SWB dimensions and stress among adults aged 65 and older between 2017 and 2022. We also tested whether these trajectories differed by age, gender, and household income. Results Life satisfaction and positive affect remained stable among older people during the pandemic (2019\u20132021) but declined after. Negative affect increased during the pandemic and decreased afterward, while stress levels increased slightly before and significantly after the pandemic. The trajectories did not differ by gender or household income, but the oldest-old (> 75-year-old) had a more significant decline in positive affect and life satisfaction pre-pandemic (2017\u20132019) and stress during the pandemic (2020\u20132021).

The effects of COVID-19 (year 2021 vs. 2017/2019 combined) and linear trend were analyzed in logistic regression models. Models were adjusted for loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sociodemographic factors. Results Among males, EIU prevalence varied minimally (7.8\u20138.1%) from 2017 to 2021.

Trans young people were at significantly elevated risk of mental ill-health in co-occurrence with cigarette and marijuana use compared with their cisgender peers (Fisher\u2019s Exact Test of Independence p \u2009<\u20090.05 for all), whereas sexuality diverse young people were at greater risk of co-occurring mental ill-health and cigarette co-use and marijuana co-use, compared with their non-sexuality diverse peers (adjusted multinomial odds ratios (aMORs) ranging 2.2-6.0). Conclusion Mental ill-health, substance use, and their co-occurrence disproportionately affects gender and sexuality diverse young people in Australia. Further research should study the longitudinal development of these disparities through adolescence, with close attention to the social, embodied contexts of substance use among LGBTQ\u2009+\u2009young people with the view to building LGBTQ\u2009+\u2009affirming models of harm reduction.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Gender", "Sexuality", "Adolescents", "Mental health", "Substance use", "Comorbidity"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-024-02714-1", "publicationDate": "2024-12-01"}, {"title": "Sexual harassment, sexual violence and subsequent depression and anxiety symptoms among Swedish university students: a cohort study", "abstract": "Purpose To determine the gender-specific impact of recent exposure to different forms of sexual harassment and sexual violence (SHV) on depression and anxiety symptoms three, six, and nine months later.

Hence, this cross-regional study compared the extent of inequalities and the mediating pathways across Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the Netherlands. Methods Between July 2021 and January 2022, 25 secondary schools from diverse socioeconomic background were purposively sampled from Hong Kong, Zhejiang (Mainland China), and Limburg (the Netherlands). 3595 junior students completed an online survey during class about their socioeconomic position, psychosocial factors, and well-being. Socioeconomic inequalities were assessed by multiple linear regressions using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII), whereas the mediating pathways through learning difficulty, overall worry about COVID-19, impact on family\u2019 financial status, resilience, trust in government regarding pandemic management, and adaptation to social distancing were examined by mediation analyses moderated by regions. Results The adverse psychosocial impact of COVID-19 was stronger in the Netherlands and Hong Kong compared with Mainland China. The greatest extent of socioeconomic inequalities in the change in psychosocial well-being was observed among students in the Netherlands (SII\u2009=\u20090.59 [95% CI\u2009=\u20090.38\u20130.80]), followed by Hong Kong (SII\u2009=\u20090.37 [0.21\u20130.52]) and Mainland China (SII\u2009=\u20090.12 [0.00\u20130.23]).

Results Findings showed that 25.7% of the participants reported having experienced SI (26.5% women, 22.7% men, \ud835\uded8^2 = 1.08, p \u2009=\u2009.299). The moderated-mediation model revealed that traumatic life events fully mediated the association between depression and SI ( B \u2009=\u20090.12, p \u2009=\u2009.004; 95% CI, [0.04, 0.20]) and that racial microaggressions ( B \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.03, p \u2009=\u2009.042; 95% CI [-0.07, \u2212\u20090.00]) and internalized racism ( B \u2009=\u20090.06, p \u2009=\u2009.006; 95% CI [0.02, 0.10]) moderated this relationship. Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of addressing racial microaggressions and internalized racism in therapy contexts among Black individuals to mitigate the potential negative impacts on their mental health. They also emphasize the need to develop effective, culturally sensitive, and racially adapted suicide prevention and intervention programs for Black communities in Canada.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Depression", "Racial microaggressions", "Internalized racism", "Traumatic life events", "Suicidal ideation", "Black communities in Canada"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-024-02641-1", "publicationDate": "2024-11-01"}, {"title": "Temporal evolution of suicide by levels of rurality and deprivation among Japanese adults aged 20\u00a0years or over between 2009 and 2022", "abstract": "Purpose Previous studies have reported that levels of rurality and deprivation are factors associated with suicide risk.

Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to analyze secular trends in suicide rates by rurality and deprivation. Results Suicide rates for both men and women at different levels of rurality and deprivation remained roughly parallel during the research period. Suicide rates for men and women at all levels of rurality and deprivation were on a downward trend until around 2019, just before the onset of the pandemic. Following this, suicide rates in women showed a clear upward trend, while the trend in suicide rates for men also changed around 2019, with a slightly increasing or flat trend thereafter.

However, it is not clear if longer sleep reduces depression symptoms and if the impact of such policy change is the same across groups of adolescents. Methods We examined how gains in weekday sleep impact depression symptoms in 2,134 high school students (mean age 15.16 \u00b1 0.35 years) from the Minneapolis metropolitan area. Leveraging a natural experiment design, we used the policy change to delay school start times as an instrument to estimate the effect of a sustained gain in weekday sleep on repeatedly measured Kandel-Davies depression symptoms. We also evaluated whether allocating the policy change to subgroups with expected benefit could improve the impact of the policy. Results Over 2 years, a sustained half-hour gain in weekday sleep expected as a result of the policy change to delay start times decreased depression symptoms by 0.78 points, 95%CI (-1.32,-0.28), or 15.6% of a standard deviation. The benefit was driven by a decrease in fatigue and sleep-related symptoms. While symptoms of low mood, hopelessness, and worry were not affected by the policy on average, older students with greater daily screen use and higher BMI experienced greater improvements in mood symptoms than would be expected on average, signaling heterogeneity. Nevertheless, universal implementation outperformed prescriptive strategies.

Methods This hybrid implementation-effectiveness study guided by the Replicating Effective Programmes framework was conducted in 27 PMCH clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria. The primary implementation outcome was change in the identification rates of PND by primary health care workers (PHCW) while the primary effectiveness outcome was the difference in symptom remission (EPDS score\u2009\u2264\u20095) 6\u00a0months postpartum. Outcome measures were compared between two cohorts of pregnant women, one recruited before and the other after training PHCW to identify and treat PND. Barriers and facilitators were explored in qualitative interviews. Results Identification of PND improved from 1.4% before to 17.4% after training; post-training rate was significantly higher in clinics where PHCW routinely screened using the 2-item patient health questionnaire (24.8%) compared to non-screening clinics (5.6%). At 6-months postpartum, 60% of cohort one experienced remission from depression, compared to 56.5% cohort two [OR-0.9 (95%CI-0.6, 1.3) p \u2009=\u20090.58]. Identified facilitators for successful integration included existence of policy specifying mental health as a component of PHC, use of screening to aid identification and supportive supervision, while barriers included language and cultural attitudes towards mental health and human resource constraints. PHCW were able to make adaptations to address these barriers. Conclusions Successful implementation of task-shared care for perinatal depression requires addressing staff shortages and adopting strategies that can improve identification by non-specialist providers.

Additionally, we investigated shifts in the use of stigmatizing language. Methods Our analysis is based on four waves of representative population surveys in Germany in 1990/1993 (West Germany: N \u00a0=\u00a02044, East Germany: N \u00a0=\u00a01563), 2001 ( N \u00a0=\u00a05025), 2011 ( N \u00a0=\u00a02455), and 2020 ( N \u00a0=\u00a03042) using identical methodology. Respondents were presented with an unlabelled case vignette describing a person who exhibited symptoms of either schizophrenia or major depression. Participants were then asked to name the problem described in the vignette using an open-ended question. Results From 1990/1993 to 2020, correct identification of schizophrenia increased from 18% to 34% and from 27% to 46% for major depression. However, derogatory labels remained constant throughout all survey waves, particularly for schizophrenia (19% in 1990/1993 and 18% in 2020). For depression, more trivializing and potentially devaluing statements were recorded. Conclusion Despite the increasing use of psychiatric terminology among the general population, the persistence of derogatory labels suggests that improved MHL, reflected in higher recognition rates, may not automatically translate into a reduction in stigmatizing language. With depression, a normalization and trivialization of a severe illness could pose new challenges to people with major depression.

Therefore, this study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the Substance Use Stigma Mechanism Scale (SU-SMS-C) and set its cut-off point. Methods We recruited 1005 individuals with SUDs from Chinese rehabilitation centers. These participants completed a battery of questionnaires that included the SU-SMS-C, The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination (PDD). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the construct validity of the scale. Additionally, the Naive Bayes classifier was used to establish the cut-off point for the SU-SMS-C. We additionally explored the correlation between patient demographic characteristics and stigma. Results A confirmatory factor analysis was utilized, revealing a second-order five-factor model. Based on the Naive Bayes classifier, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUCROC) of 0.746, the cut-off point for the SU-SMS-C was established at 44.5. The prevalence of stigma observed in the study population was 49.05%. Significant disparities were observed in the distribution of stigma across genders, with males experiencing more pronounced stigma than females. Moreover, patients consuming different primary substances reported diverse levels of stigma. Notably, those primarily using heroin endured a higher degree of stigma than users of other substances.

We examined whether total number of complications experienced in the pregnancy associated with mental health at 5 and 9-years, and whether this varied by sex or adverse social circumstances. Pregnancy complications were self-reported at 9-months post-natally from a list of 16 complications.

Methods The study used data from the Health and Retirement Study in 2006\u20132018, which included a nationally representative sample of American adults aged 50 and above ( N \u2009=\u20096,832). We conducted latent growth curve models to assess the associations between trajectories of loneliness and isolation and healthcare utilisation over 8 years. Results Independent of sociodemographic and health-related confounders, social deficits were associated with a lower likelihood of baseline physician visits (loneliness \u03b2 = -0.15, SE \u2009=\u20090.08; social isolation \u03b2 = -0.19, SE \u2009=\u20090.08), but there was a positive association between loneliness and number of physician visits ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.06, SE \u2009=\u20090.03), while social isolation was associated with extended hospital ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.07, SE \u2009=\u20090.04) and nursing home stays ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.05, SE \u2009=\u20090.02).

The human capital method (HCM) and the friction cost method (FCM) are the two most common approaches to assess productivity costs. The HCM focuses on employees\u2019 perspectives on the costs, whereas the FCM demonstrates employers\u2019 perspectives. Studies comparing these methods when estimating the productivity costs of psychoses are lacking. Methods Utilizing the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with linkages to national registers, we compared the adjusted productivity costs of SSD ( n \u2009=\u2009216) and OP ( n \u2009=\u2009217). The productivity costs were estimated from ages 18 to 53 including projections to statutory retirement age using the FCM and HCM.

The majority of the fit statistics were acceptable with the exception of the RMSEA statistic. Internal consistency and test\u2013retest reliability were good for all subscales. The disorganised subscale correlated in expected directions with other measures of attachment, dissociation, trauma, and psychotic experiences. Conclusion The PAM-R is a valid and reliable measure of adult attachment. It is a practical assessment tool for clinicians and researchers to measure insecure and disorganised attachment patterns that is acceptable to people experiencing psychosis.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Self-report", "Psychometric", "Questionnaire", "Validity", "Reliability"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-024-02624-2", "publicationDate": "2024-10-01"}, {"title": "Perinatal depression and its associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "Purpose Perinatal depression significantly impacts maternal and child health, with further complexities arising during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022326991). This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guideline for prevalence studies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in six databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ProQuest. Pooled prevalence estimates were computed for both prenatal and postnatal depression. Identified risk factors were summarized narratively. Results A total of 5169 studies were screened, out of which 58 were included in the narrative review and 48 [prenatal ( n \u2009=\u200936) and postnatal ( n \u2009=\u200917)] were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled depression prevalence for prenatal women was 23% (95% CI: 19\u201327%), and for the postnatal women was 23% (95% CI: 18\u201330%). Maternal age, education, perceived fear of COVID-19 infection, week of pregnancy, pregnancy complications, and social and family support were identified as associated risk factors for depression.

We aimed to estimate the frequency of PPTGH among past users of psychiatric treatments, particularly antidepressants. Methods We used a subsample of UnACoRN, a US/Canada survey of sexual and gender minority youth aged 15 to 29. We included participants with a history of psychiatric drug use. We excluded individuals with genital surgeries or without sexual experience. The analysis involved chi-square tests for initial group comparisons, post hoc tests for multiple comparisons, and logistic regression among those who had stopped taking medication. We exponentiated the regression to estimate the odds of PPTGH by drug type, adjusting for age, sex-assigned-at-birth, hormone treatment, and depression severity in three nested models. Results 574 of 2179 survey participants reported genital hypoesthesia. They were older and more likely to report male sex assignment at birth, hormonal therapy history, and psychiatric drug history. The frequency of PPTGH among antidepressant users was 13.2% (93/707) compared to 0.9% (1/102) among users of other medications; adjusted odds ratio: 14.2 (95% CI: 2.92 to 257). Conclusion Antidepressant discontinuation is strongly associated with PPTGH in the US and Canada where SSRI/SNRI medications account for 80% of antidepressant prescriptions.

Using an intersectional framework, we explored associations between ethnic-sexual identities and MH-OB comorbidity in adolescents. We examined the risk of self-harm (SH) and attempted suicide (AS) by comorbidity status and ethnic-sexual identities. Methods Participants included 9,789 adolescents (aged 17 years) from the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study with data on self-identified ethnicity and sexuality.

However, this topic has not received adequate academic attention. Gosiwon is a type of small residence consisting of several tiny rooms densely packed together and usually does not meet minimum housing standards. However, gosiwons are favored by low-income groups, especially young people, because they are cheaper than other residences. This study aimed to examine the factors that increase the risk of suicidal ideation and attempt among young people living in gosiwons. Methods A sample of 300 young people aged 19\u201334 years living in gosiwons for over 6 months was analyzed. A set of multinomial logistic regression was conducted to examine the factors that differentiate the suicidal ideation and attempt group from the no-suicidal risk group. Results Approximately 30% of the study participants experienced suicidal ideation or attempted suicide. Among several risk factors, social exclusion and depressive symptoms distinguished the group with suicidal ideation from the no-risk group. Depressive symptoms were the only factor that differentiated the group with suicide attempts history from the no-risk group.

For other mental disorders, a large body of research suggests that continuum beliefs (i.e., the endorsement of continuum perspectives on mental health and psychopathology) stimulate more favorable attitudes toward affected persons. Additionally, mental disorder classification systems increasingly incorporate continuous personality disorder models.

The objective of our study was to estimate the association between suicide bereavement and general practitioner (GP) consultations for mental health reasons. Methods A population-wide, register-based cohort study identifying 25,580 individuals bereaved by suicide. Estimations of increases in consultation rate were modeled through individual fixed-effects linear analyses adjusted for age and time-period. Results Overall, 35% of those bereaved by suicide had a GP consultation for mental health reasons during the first 1\u20132\u00a0months, and 53% after two years. In the month immediately after bereavement by suicide, there was a large increase in the consultation rate with a GP for mental health reasons. In the months that followed, the consultation rate gradually decreased. One year after bereavement, the consultation rate stabilized at a somewhat higher level than before the death. The increase in consultation rate was evident across all kinship groups, and the increase was greatest for partners and smallest for siblings. Women had more contact with the GP before the suicide and a greater increase in contact than men. Conclusion Our findings suggest that many of those bereaved by suicide seek assistance from primary health care, and that some are in need of prolonged follow-up from the GP.

Results In adjusted analyses, EP at 9\u00a0m or 3\u00a0y of age was associated with higher total difficulties score at 3\u00a0y (0.66, 95% CI 0.41, 0.91) and 5\u00a0y (0.77, 95% CI 0.48, 1.05) but not at 7\u00a0y or 9\u00a0y. EP at 9\u00a0y was associated with higher total difficulties score at 9\u00a0y (1.73, 95% CI 1.28, 2.18), with this difference reducing over time leading to 0.68 (95% CI 0.19, 1.17) at 17/18\u00a0y.

Here, we specifically focus on the relevance of spirituality and perceived social support in this regard. Methods 161 individuals who had been diagnosed with MHD and 446 reference subjects participated in this online survey. Electronic data capture was conducted using the Computer-based Health Evaluation System and included both sociodemographic and clinical aspects as well as standardized questionnaires on psychological distress, spirituality, and the perception of social support. Results The prevalence of psychological distress was significantly higher in individuals with MHD (36.6% vs. 12.3%) and remained unchanged among both groups over time. At baseline, the perception of social support was significantly higher in healthy control subjects, whereas the two groups were comparable in regards of the subjective relevance of faith. Reference subjects indicated significantly higher spiritual well-being in terms of the sense of meaning in life and peacefulness, which mediated in large part the between-group difference of psychological distress at follow-up.

Indeed, identifying predictors of engagement is crucial to maximize mental healthcare interventions in first-episode psychosis (FEP). No Italian study on this topic has been reported to date. Thus, the aims of this investigation were: (1) to examine short-term disengagement rate in an Italian population of FEP patients treated within an EIP service across a 1-year follow-up period, and (b) to assess the most relevant predictors of disengagement in the first year of treatment.

Across the follow-up, a 16.5% prevalence of short-term disengagement was found. Particularly robust predictors of service disengagement were poor baseline treatment non-adherence, living with parents and the presence of brief psychotic disorder or schizophreniform disorder at entry. Conclusion About 16% of FEP patients disengaged the Pr-EP program within the first year of treatment.

At time of presentation, 50.2% were admitted. On multivariate analysis, the following factors predicted admission: being a migrant (OR\u2009=\u20091.75, 95% CI [1.17, 2.62]), aggression (OR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI [1.02, 1.99]), and more severe psychotic symptoms.

As an initial test of this theory, the current study examined whether self-reported environmental resource deprivation was associated with anhedonia, avolition, and asociality. Method Two samples were collected: (1) outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ: n\u2009=\u2009 38) and matched psychiatrically heathy controls (CN: n\u2009=\u2009 31); (2) youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR: n\u2009=\u2009 34) and matched CN ( n\u2009=\u2009 30). Measures of negative symptoms and environmental factors influencing the frequency of recreational, goal-directed, and social activities were collected. Results Negative symptoms were associated with environmental deprivation factors in the microsystem (number of social and activity settings) and exosystem (economy, mass media, politics/laws, neighborhood crime). These associations did not appear due to depression and were greater among those with SZ than CHR.

Results All 10 articles observed increases in depressive symptoms and disorders in adolescents across recent survey years with increases observed between 1991 and 2020. Of the 3 articles that assessed birth cohort trends, birth cohort trends were less prominent than time period trends. Proposed explanations for increases included social media, economic-related reasons, changes in mental health screening and diagnosis, declining mental health stigma, increased treatment, and, in more recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Multiple cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies documented rising prevalence of depressive symptoms and disorder among adolescents from 1991 to 2020. Mechanisms driving this increase are still unknown.

Social isolation was assessed using the short form of the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6). The LSNS-6 contains two sets of items establishing psychometrically separable subscales for isolation from family and friends (ranges 0\u201315 points), with lower scores indicating higher isolation. Cross-sectional linear (OLS) regression analyses were used to examine multivariate associations of sociodemographic and health-related determinants with social isolation from family and friends. Results Overall, n \u2009=\u2009395 participants (34.6%) were considered socially isolated. On average, isolation was higher from friends (mean 6.0, SD 3.8) than from family (mean 8.0, SD 3.5).

Internalizing symptoms\u2014such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma exposure\u2014are commonly cited to be related to delusions and delusional ideation and are often associated with deficits in social functioning. While emerging studies are investigating the impact of low social engagement on psychotic-like experiences, little work has examined the relationship between social engagement, internalizing symptoms, and delusional ideation, specifically. Methods Using general population data from the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland (NKI-Rockland) database ( N \u2009=\u2009526), we examined the relationships between self-reported delusional ideation, internalizing symptoms, and social engagement and tested four indirect effect models to understand how these factors interrelate.

Socio-demographic inequalities in these outcomes varied across neighbourhoods. Several neighbourhood characteristics were associated with wellbeing, but differences across model specifications were observed (e.g. adjusted vs unadjusted; unique associations vs grouped domains). However, higher levels of perceived wellbeing support from local people were associated with lower internalising symptoms in all models. Other characteristics associated with better wellbeing outcomes in various models included lower GP antidepressant prescription rates, and better access to health services, areas for leisure, and good places to spend free time.

Methods Population-wide data from the Northern Ireland Registry of Self-Harm from April 2012 were linked with centrally held mortality records to December 2019, providing data on self-harm type and ED care. Cox proportional hazards models analyzed mortality risk, coded as suicide, all-external causes and all-cause mortality. Results Analysis of the 64,350 ED presentations for self-harm by 30,011 individuals confirmed a marked variation across EDs in proportion of patients receiving mental health assessment and likelihood of admission to general and psychiatric wards. There was a significant variation in suicide risk following attendance according to ED attended with the three-fold range between the lowest (HR_adj 0.32 95% CIs 0.16, 0.67) and highest. These differences persisted even after adjustment for patient characteristics, variation in types of self-harm, and care management at the ED.

The median cost per student was \u00a3518 (IQR \u00a3275\u2013\u00a3840), cost per course designed was \u00a35,556 (IQR \u00a33,000\u2013\u00a39,416) and per course run was \u00a31,510 (IQR \u00a3682\u2013\u00a33,030). The total annual budget across England for RCs is an estimated \u00a317.6\u00a0m including \u00a313.4\u00a0m from NHS budgets, with 11,000 courses delivered to 45,500 students. Conclusion Although the majority of RCs had high levels of fidelity, there were sufficiently pronounced differences in other key characteristics to generate a typology of RCs. This typology might prove important for understanding student outcomes and how they are achieved and for commissioning decisions. Staffing and co-producing new courses are key drivers of spending.

Methods The i-Share cohort recruited French students from February 2013 to July 2020. The study included 4270 participants. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was used to evaluate ADHD symptoms at inclusion. Illicit stimulants use was assessed at inclusion and 1 year after inclusion. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to assess the association between ADHD symptoms at inclusion and illicit stimulants use following 1 year.

Methods Data were collected from Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (HALMED) and presented as defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID). The consumption before (2012\u20132019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020\u20132021) was compared with interrupted time series analysis. Results There was an increase in total consumption of analyzed psychotropic drugs in Croatia between the years 2012 and 2021, from 115.47 DDD/TID in 2012 to 155.50 DDD/TID in 2021. An increasing trend was observed in the consumption of all 4 analyzed groups of medicines (antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, and antidepressants).

It is unknown if the purported superior outcomes for psychosis in some low- and middle-income countries extend to fundamental treatment processes like trust. Addressing this gap, we studied two similar first-episode psychosis programs in Montreal, Canada, and Chennai, India. We hypothesized higher trust in healthcare institutions and providers among patients and families in Chennai at baseline and over follow-up. Methods Upon treatment entry and at months 3, 12 and 24, trust in healthcare providers was measured using the Wake Forest Trust scale and trust in the healthcare and mental healthcare systems using two single items. Nonparametric tests were performed to compare trust levels across sites and mixed-effects linear regression models to investigate predictors of trust in healthcare providers. Results The study included 333 patients (Montreal\u2009=\u2009165, Chennai\u2009=\u2009168) and 324 family members (Montreal\u2009=\u2009128, Chennai\u2009=\u2009168). Across all timepoints, Chennai patients and families had higher trust in healthcare providers and the healthcare and mental healthcare systems. The effect of site on trust in healthcare providers was significant after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics known to impact trust. Patients' trust in doctors increased over follow-up.

The additive interaction between CCW and low work engagement was estimated by calculating Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI). Results Exposure to CCW was related to insomnia (OR [95% CI] 1.33 [1.22\u20131.46]). Additionally, a significant negative interaction between CCW and work engagement was observed. The effects of CCW were mitigated in those with high work engagement. The OR of the combined effect of CCW exposure and low work engagement was 2.52 (95% CI 2.22\u20132.87).

Methods The final data set included 13,783 first-time mood disorder DP recipients and 1088 mental health service units in 104 municipalities. We focused on five different MHS types: all MHS, outpatient care provision, local services without and with gatekeeping, and centralized services. Three factors for each MHS type were studied: service resources, richness, and diversity index. Negative binomial regression models were used in the analysis. Results In all the municipalities, higher service richness and diversity regarding all MHS, outpatient care and local services with gatekeeping were associated with a lower DP risk. In urban municipalities, service richness was mainly associated with lower DP risk, and in semi-urban municipalities service diversity and resources were primarily associated with lower DP risk in outpatient care and local services with gatekeeping. In rural municipalities, DP risk indicated no association with MHS factors. Conclusion The organization and structure of MHS play a role in psychiatric disability pensioning.

This study aimed to document the association between pandemic stressors and mental health during the pandemic across countries that differ in cultural, geographic, economic, and demographic factors. Methods We administered an online survey randomly in Brazil, China, Germany, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United States from September 2020 to November 2020. This survey included questions on Covid-19-related stressors as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the Primary Care PTSD Checklist to screen for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, respectively. We performed bivariable and multivariable regression analyses to assess the prevalence and odds ratios of overall depression symptoms and probable PTSD and in relation to stressors across countries. Results Among 8754 respondents, 28.9% (95% CI 27.5\u201330.0%) experienced depression symptoms, and 5.1% (95% CI 4.5\u20136.0%) experienced probable PTSD. The highest prevalence of depression symptoms was in Egypt (41.3%, 95% CI 37.6\u201345.0%) and lowest in the United States (24.9%, 95% CI 22.3\u201327.7%).

Results Latent class analysis detected five pathways with good fit statistics. The Networked General Care Path (37.0%) and The Kin General Care Path (14.5%) differ only in whether friends are activated in using the general care sector. The Networked Multi-Sector Care Path (32.5%) and The Saturated Path (12.6%) involve family, friends, and both general and specialty care with only the latter expanding consultation to coworkers and clergy. The Null Path (3.3%), or no contacts, is not used as perceived problem severity increases. Network size and strength are associated with the more complex pathways that activate ties, respectively. Trust in doctors is associated with pathways that include specialty providers but not others at work or church. Race, age, and rural residence have specific pathway effects, while gender has no significant impact. Conclusions Social networks propel individuals with mental health problems into action. Tie strength and trust produce care responses that are fuller and more targeted. Considering the nature of homophily, results also suggest that majority status and college education are clearly implicated in networked pathways. Overall, findings support community-targeted rather than individually based efforts to increase service use.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Utilization", "Network episode model", "Social networks", "Health disparities", "Mental health services"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-023-02476-2", "publicationDate": "2024-03-01"}, {"title": "The ambiguities of social inclusion in mental health: learning from lived experience of serious mental illness in Ghana and the occupied Palestinian territory", "abstract": "Purpose Social inclusion of people living with serious mental illness is widely promoted. However, only limited consideration has been given to the meanings of social inclusion within different settings and the ways in which it is envisioned, negotiated, and practised. In this paper, we explore meanings and practises of social inclusion from the perspectives of people living with serious mental illness and their families in Ghana and Palestine and how this is shaped by differing political and socio-cultural contexts. Methods This paper draws on comparative ethnographic research including participant observation and interviews with people living with mental illness and family members in Ghana and the occupied Palestinian territory. Data were triangulated and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Participants described experiences of social inclusion and participation within communities, home and family life, friendships and social life, and work and livelihoods. This revealed how such experiences were variously shaped by differing political contexts and socio-cultural norms and expectations within the two settings. These in turn intersected with aspects such as gender roles, age, and socio-economic status. Aspirations for inclusion included greater awareness and understanding within society, accompanied by opportunities and support for meaningful inclusion at the political as well as community level.

We aim to provide an inclusive socio-demographic mapping of different mental health measures in the population using quantitative methods that are consistent with an intersectional perspective. Methods Data included 8,588 participants from two British cohorts (born in 1990 and 2000\u20132002, respectively), collected in February/March 2021 (during the third UK nationwide lockdown). Measures of anxiety and depressive symptomatology, loneliness, and life satisfaction were analysed using Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) models. Results We found evidence of large mental health inequalities across intersectional strata. Large proportions of those inequalities were accounted for by the additive effects of the variables used to define the intersections, with some of the largest gaps associated with sexual orientation (with sexual minority groups showing substantially worse outcomes). Additional inequalities were found by cohort/generation, birth sex, racial/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic position. Intersectional effects were observed mostly in intersections defined by combinations of privileged and marginalised social identities/positions (e.g., lower-than-expected life satisfaction in South Asian men in their thirties from a sexual minority and a disadvantaged childhood social class).

With funding, convening, and publishing power still concentrated in institutions in the global North, efforts to decolonize GMH emphasize the need for mutual learning instead of unidirectional knowledge transfers. This article reflects on mutuality as a concept and practice that engenders sustainable relations, conceptual innovation, and queries how epistemic power can be shared. Methods We draw on insights from an online mutual learning process over 8 months between 39 community-based and academic collaborators working in 24 countries. They came together to advance the shift towards a social paradigm in GMH. Results Our theorization of mutuality emphasizes that the processes and outcomes of knowledge production are inextricable. Mutual learning required an open-ended, iterative, and slower paced process that prioritized trust and remained responsive to all collaborators\u2019 needs and critiques. This resulted in a social paradigm that calls for GMH to (1) move from a deficit to a strength-based view of community mental health, (2) include local and experiential knowledge in scaling processes, (3) direct funding to community organizations, and (4) challenge concepts, such as trauma and resilience, through the lens of lived experience of communities in the global South.

Recent literature has called for more attention to the ways they operate and the strategies used. For example, how do they translate biomedical concepts into frameworks that are acceptable and accessible to communities? How do micro-innovations lead to positive mental health outcomes, including social inclusion and recovery? The aim of this study was to examine the types of skills and strategies to address social dimensions of mental health used by community health workers (CHWs) working together with people with psychosocial disability (PPSD) in urban north India. Methods We interviewed CHWs (n = 46) about their registered PPSD who were randomly selected from 1000 people registered with a local non-profit community mental health provider. Notes taken during interviews were cross-checked with audio recordings and coded and analyzed thematically. Results CHWs displayed social, cultural, and psychological skills in forming trusting relationships and in-depth knowledge of the context of their client's lives and family dynamics. They used this information to analyze political, social, and economic factors influencing mental health for the client and their family members. The diverse range of analysis and intervention skills of community health workers built on contextual knowledge to implement micro-innovations in a be-spoke way, applying these to the local ecology of people with psychosocial disabilities (PPSD). These approaches contributed to addressing the social and structural determinants that shaped the mental health of PPSD. Conclusion Community health workers (CHWs) in this study addressed social aspects of mental health, individually, and by engaging with wider structural factors.

Alcohol is an important risk factor for self-harm; however, little is known about its role in pesticide self-poisoning. This scoping review explores the role that alcohol plays in pesticide self-harm and suicide. Methods The review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review guidance. Searches were undertaken in 14 databases, Google Scholar, and relevant websites. Articles were included if they focussed on pesticide self-harm and/or suicide and involvement of alcohol. Results Following screening of 1281 articles, 52 were included. Almost half were case reports ( n \u2009=\u200924) and 16 focussed on Sri Lanka. Just over half described the acute impact of alcohol ( n \u2009=\u2009286), followed by acute and chronic alcohol use ( n \u2009=\u20099), chronic use, ( n \u2009=\u20094,) and only two articles addressed harm to others. One systematic review/meta-analysis showed increased risk of intubation and death in patients with co-ingested alcohol and pesticides. Most individuals who consumed alcohol before self-harming with pesticides were men, but alcohol use among this group also led to pesticide self-harm among family members.

Results We found significant period and cohort effects, with peek values for mental distress in the years 2017 and 2020 and for the oldest birth cohort (born before 1946). Age did not affect mental distress when cohort- and period effects as well as gender and German region were considered. An interaction effect for gender and the German region was found. Women in West Germany reported significantly higher mental distress compared to women in East Germany. Compared to men, women reported the highest prevalence in both regions. Conclusion Important political events as well as major crises can lead to an increase of mental distress in societies. Furthermore, an association between birth cohort and mental distress could be linked to socialization effects of that certain time, causing traumatic experiences or a specific coping style within this cohort group. Prevention and intervention strategies could benefit from acknowledging structural differences linked to period and cohort effects.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Mental distress", "Age-period-cohort", "Temporal trends", "Gender", "East and West Germany"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-023-02479-z", "publicationDate": "2024-02-01"}, {"title": "How well can U.S. military veterans\u2019 suicidal ideation be predicted from static and change-based indicators of their psychosocial well-being as they adapt to civilian life?", "abstract": "Background Identifying predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) is important to inform suicide prevention efforts, particularly among high-risk populations like military veterans. Although many studies have examined the contribution of psychopathology to veterans\u2019 SI, fewer studies have examined whether experiencing good psychosocial well-being with regard to multiple aspects of life can protect veterans from SI or evaluated whether SI risk prediction can be enhanced by considering change in life circumstances along with static factors. Methods The study drew from a longitudinal population-based sample of 7141 U.S. veterans assessed throughout the first three years after leaving military service. Machine learning methods (cross-validated random forests) were applied to examine the predictive utility of static and change-based well-being indicators to veterans\u2019 SI, as compared to psychopathology predictors. Results Although psychopathology models performed better, the full set of well-being predictors demonstrated acceptable discrimination in predicting new-onset SI and accounted for approximately two-thirds of cases of SI in the top strata (quintile) of predicted risk. Greater engagement in health promoting behavior and social well-being were most important in predicting reduced SI risk, with several change-based predictors of SI identified but stronger associations observed for static as compared to change-based indicator sets as a whole. Conclusions Findings support the value of considering veterans\u2019 broader well-being in identifying individuals at risk for suicidal ideation and suggest the possibility that well-being promotion efforts may be useful in reducing suicide risk.

However, research on the heterogeneity of the longitudinal course of psychological symptoms during the pandemic and the predispositions linked with these courses is still scarce. This study aimed to identify differential trajectories of depressive symptoms among the parents of young children and investigate the role of temperament traits, alexithymia, and coping styles in the heterogeneity of the symptom trajectories. Methods The sample consists of 844 parents from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Latent growth mixture modeling was utilized to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms from pre-pandemic between 2014 and 2019 (T0, the closest available measurement was used) to May/June 2020 (T1) and December 2020 (T2) during the pandemic. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine temperament, alexithymia, and coping as predictors of symptom trajectories, controlling for various background factors. Results Four trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified. Most parents experienced low and stable depressive symptoms. Negative affect, effortful control, alexithymia, emotion-diverting coping (self-distraction and venting), and avoidant coping (denial and behavioral disengagement) were predictors for subclinical stable depressive symptoms. Constructive coping (positive reframing, acceptance, and humor) protected the cohort parents from increasing or moderately high depressive symptoms.

Methods Nationwide population registers from 2011 to 2017 and healthcare registers from 1975 to 2017. We used 19 administrative and three aggregate regions based on the distribution of schizophrenia polygenic risk scores, and a seven-level urban\u2013rural classification. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated by Poisson regression models and adjusted for gender, age, and calendar year (basic adjustments), and Finnish origin, residential history, urbanicity, household income, economic activity, and physical comorbidity (additional adjustments) on an individual level.

We performed multivariable Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios of delay to EIS. Negative binomial regression was used to determine LOS with EIS by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, controlling for confounders. Results 343 patients were eligible for an EIS, 34.1% of whom did not receive the service. Overall, the median delay to EIS was 120\u00a0days (IQR; 15\u20131668); and the median LOS was 130.5\u00a0days (IQR 0\u2013663).

However, their mental health can often be overlooked. In recent years, with increasing attention to mental health and wellness, common mental illness such as depression in caregivers of people with schizophrenia has received renewed attention. The purpose of this review was to consolidate and synthesize recent literature on (1) the prevalence of depression in caregivers of people with schizophrenia, (2) factors associated with depression in caregivers of people with schizophrenia, and (3) interventions that target depression in caregivers of people with schizophrenia. Methods A systematic search focusing on literature published between 2010 and 2022 was done to retrieve relevant articles from the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid Psych INFO. Results Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Nine evaluated the prevalence of depression, 18 evaluated factors associated with depression in caregivers, and 6 examined interventions targeting depression. The prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in samples of caregivers ranged between 12 and 40% across the studies. Females, especially mothers of people with schizophrenia, were more likely to experience depression, followed by younger caregivers. Several factors, including gender, interpersonal relationships, social support, stigma, literacy, and financial constraints, were identified as factors associated with depression in caregivers. Several interventions like yoga, emotional training, and psychoeducation were evaluated, and they showed a significant reduction in the level of depression and depressive symptoms experienced by the caregiver population.

Enduring mental ill-health and disengagement from education/employment were associated with psychosocial risk factors rather than assault characteristics. Qualitative data suggested inter-relationships between mental ill-health, physical health problems and disengagement from school, and poor understanding from schools regarding how to support young people post-assault. Baseline levels of smoking, alcohol and ever drug use were high and increased during the study period (only significantly for alcohol use). Conclusion Adolescents presenting after sexual assault have high levels of vulnerability over a year post-assault. Many remain at risk for mental health disorders, highlighting the need for specialist intervention and ongoing support. A key concern for young people is disruption to their education. Multi-faceted support is needed to prevent social exclusion and further widening of health inequalities in this population, and to support young people in their immediate and long-term recovery.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Adolescent", "Rape", "Sexual assault", "Mental health", "Education", "Longitudinal cohort study"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-021-02127-4", "publicationDate": "2023-12-01"}, {"title": "Correction to: Prevalence and correlates of perinatal depression", "abstract": "", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": [], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-023-02468-2", "publicationDate": "2023-11-01"}, {"title": "Does the peer-led Honest, Open, Proud program reduce stigma\u2019s impact for everyone?

In randomized controlled trials, HOP has shown positive effects on self-stigma and stigma stress on average. This study examined individual predictors of HOP outcomes and tested the hypothesis that stigma stress reduction at the end of HOP mediates positive HOP effects at follow-up. Methods Six RCTs were included with data at baseline, post (after the HOP program) and at 3- or 4-week follow-up.

Mediation models examined change in stigma stress (post) as a mediator of HOP effects on self-stigma, depressive symptoms, and quality of life at follow-up. Results More shame at baseline, and for some outcomes reduced empowerment, predicted reduced HOP effects on stigma stress, self-stigma, depressive symptoms, and quality of life.

With child psychopathology on the rise, the identification of modifiable risk factors is needed to promote maternal and child well-being. In this study, we examined associations of maternal exposure to childhood traumatic events (CTE) and pregnancy stressful life events (PSLE) with child mental health problems in a large, sociodemographically diverse sample. Methods Participants were mother\u2013child dyads in the ECHO-PATHWAYS consortium\u2019s harmonized data across three U.S. pregnancy cohorts. Women completed questionnaires regarding their own exposure to CTE and PSLE, and their 4\u20136-year-old child\u2019s mental health problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).

Results Among 1948 dyads (child age M \u2009=\u20095.13 (SD\u2009=\u20091.02) years; 38% Black, 44% White; 8.5% Hispanic), maternal history of CTE and PSLE were independently associated with children\u2019s psychopathology: higher CTE and PSLE counts were related to higher total problems ([\u00df_CTE\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI [.06, .16]; \u00df_SLE\u2009=\u20090.21, 95% CI [.14, 0.27]) and greater odds of clinical levels of problems (OR_CTE\u2009=\u20091.41; 95% CI [1.12, 1.78]; OR_PSLE\u2009=\u20091.36; 95% CI [1.23, 1.51]). Tests of interaction showed PSLEs were more strongly associated with child problems for each additional CTE experienced. Conclusion Findings confirm that maternal exposure to CTE and PSLE are independently associated with child mental health, and history of CTE exacerbates the risk associated with PSLE, highlighting intergenerational risk pathways for early psychopathology.

Given that Black faith organisations are considered a primary source of emotional and psychological support they are well positioned as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 for services, to overcome barriers to engagement and build trusting relationships with the Black community. The aim of this paper is to pilot a manualised mental health awareness and stigma reduction intervention for Black faith communities in the UK, and to make an initial assessment of feasibility, acceptability and outcomes. Methods This study employed a mixed methods pre\u2013post-design, based upon the Medical Research Council Framework (MRC) for complex interventions, and the Implementation Science Research Development. Results The qualitative assessments indicate that the intervention was found overall to be acceptable and feasible to the Black faith community population. This pilot study did not find statistically significant changes for the Mental Health Knowledge schedule (MAKS), Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS), intended help-seeking or willingness to disclose (Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey) measures. However, the direction of all the non-significant changes in these measures suggests positive changes in mental health knowledge, a reduction in participants\u2019 desire for social distance, and greater willingness to disclose personal experiences of mental health problems. A statistically significant improvement in the Community Attitudes towards Mental Illness (CAMI) scale results indicated a lower level of stigmatising attitudes towards people with lived experience of mental health conditions (PWLE), and an increase in tolerance and support towards PWLE after the intervention. Significant improvement in the willingness to disclose measure suggests increased preparedness to seek help amongst participants, a lesser desire for social distance, and greater willingness to engage with PWLE after the intervention. Three key themes, including 9 subthemes were identified from the qualitative data analysis: (i) initial implementation and intention to adopt; (ii) perceived suitability and usefulness of intervention to address cultural issues relating to mental health in the Black community; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of faith leaders. Conclusions This ON TRAC pilot study shows that the intervention was feasible and acceptable, and that it has promising positive impacts and next requires larger scale evaluation.

Methods Cross-sectional data for 4896 students, age 14\u201318, were drawn from the 2019 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey. Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler-6 Distress Scale, unmet mental health needs were defined by self-report (yes/no), and non-prescription medication use was defined by self-reported frequency of use. Using logistic regression, we explored the effect of the non-medical use of prescription medications on the relationship between psychological distress and unmet mental health needs. Results High proportions of Ontario students reported serious psychological distress (22%), some degree of unmet mental health need (38%), and/or non-medical use of prescription medications (13%). While there were strong associations between psychological distress and unmet mental health need, this association was weaker among those reporting non-medical use of prescription medications (OR\u2009=\u20093.3, 95% CI 1.9\u20135.7) compared to non-users (OR\u2009=\u20095.6, 95% CI 4.5\u20137.1). Conclusion Our findings suggest that Ontario students experiencing distress and using non-prescribed medications are less likely to identify a need for mental health support, highlighting the consequences of apparent self-medication through misuse of prescription medications. To assist in the redirection of adolescent perceptions of healthy coping strategies, population-based educational programming, with targeted promotion of both formal and informal mental health care resources, should be considered.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Adolescent", "Mental health", "Psychological distress", "Prescriptions", "Psychological adaptation", "Health survey"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-023-02450-y", "publicationDate": "2023-10-01"}, {"title": "Longitudinal patterns of polysubstance use throughout adolescence: association with adult substance use and psychosocial outcomes controlling for preadolescent risk factors in a male cohort", "abstract": "Purpose Inconsistent reports raise the question of the extent to which poor adult outcomes are associated with adolescent polysubstance use (PSU: alcohol, marijuana, other illicit drugs) above and beyond earlier risk factors. Methods Early adulthood substance-related and psychosocial outcomes were examined in association with age 13 to 17 developmental patterns of PSU in boys from urban, low SES neighborhoods ( N \u2009=\u2009926). Three classes obtained by latent growth modeling described low/non-users ( N \u2009=\u2009565, 61.0%), lower risk PSU (later onset, occasional use, 2\u2009\u2264\u2009substances; N \u2009=\u2009223, 24.1%), and higher risk PSU (earlier onset, frequent use, 3\u2009\u2265\u2009substances; N \u2009=\u2009138, 14.9%). Preadolescent individual, familial and social predictors of adolescent PSU patterns were used as covariates. Results Adolescent PSU contributed to both age-24 substance-related outcomes (frequency of alcohol, drug use, and getting drunk, risky behaviors under influence, and use-related problems) and psychosocial outcomes (no high school diploma, professional or financial strain, ASP symptoms, criminal record) over and above preadolescent risk factors. Controlling for preadolescent risk factors, adolescent PSU made a more important contribution to adult substance use outcomes (increasing the risk by about 110%) than to psychosocial outcomes (16.8% risk increase). PSU classes showed poorer adjustment for all age-24 substance use, and for various psychosocial outcomes than low/non-users. Higher risk polysubstance users also reported poorer outcomes than their lower risk peers for most substance use outcomes, and for professional or financial strain and criminal record.

SDoH may provide proximal, actionable targets for interventions. This study examined how SDoH are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms among Veterans and non-Veterans with probable PTSD or depression. Methods Four multiple regressions were conducted. Two multiple regressions with Veterans examined the impact of SDoH on PTSD symptoms and on depression symptoms. Two multiple regressions with non-Veterans examined the impact of SDoH on PTSD symptoms and on depression symptoms. Independent variables included demographic characteristics, adverse experiences (in childhood and adulthood), and SDoH (discrimination, education, employment, economic instability, homelessness, justice involvement, and social support). Correlates that were statistically significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) and clinically meaningful ( r _part\u2009>|0.10|) were interpreted. Results For Veterans, lower social support ( r _part\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.14) and unemployment ( r _part\u2009=\u20090.12) were associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Among non-Veterans, greater economic instability ( r _part\u2009=\u20090.19) was associated with greater PTSD symptoms. In the depression models, lower social support ( r _part\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.23) and greater economic instability ( r _part\u2009=\u20090.12) were associated with greater depression for Veterans, while only lower social support was associated with greater depression for non-Veterans ( r _part\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.14). Conclusion Among Veterans and non-Veterans with probable PTSD or depression, SDoH were associated with PTSD and depression symptoms, particularly social support, economic instability, and employment. Beyond direct treatment of mental health symptoms, addressing social support and economic factors such as instability and employment in the context of PTSD and depression are potential intervention targets that would benefit from future research.", "disciplines": ["Psychiatry", "Epidemiology"], "keywords": ["Posttraumatic stress disorder", "Social determinants of health", "Depression", "Veteran", "Social support"], "doi": "doi:10.1007/s00127-023-02478-0", "publicationDate": "2023-10-01"}]
