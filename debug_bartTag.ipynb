But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.

If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

This  is most refreshing.\\n\\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\\nMy brigade\\'s quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\\n\\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I\\'m not sure the Swiss\\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\\nbut are probably similar.\\n\\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\\n\\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \\nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\\n\\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \\n\\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton\\'s opinion as being the sole\\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\\n\\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\\n\\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \\nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\\nFederal Courts.\\n\\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton\\'s\\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\\ntheir units didn\\'t drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\\nbe so bold.\\n\\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\\nConstitution.\\n \\nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today\\'s\\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States\\' keeping nuclear missiles.\\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \\n\\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State\\'s Militia.', 'labels': ['comp.sys.mac.hardware', 'sci.space', 'comp.graphics', 'rec.autos', 'talk.politics.guns'], 'scores': [0.41775140166282654, 0.18356825411319733, 0.14734312891960144, 0.14425672590732574, 0.10708046704530716]}, {'sequence': '\\nThere was a recession, and none of the potential entrants could raise any\\nmoney.

It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.

Most of the other\\nmodels are in the same class, but aren\\'t the first cars you would think of.\\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn\\'t include domestic small\\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\\nroots.\\n\\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\\n\\nToyota Paseo\\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\\nMazda MX-3\\nIsuzu Impulse\\nGeo Storm\\nFord Escort GT\\n\\n\\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they\\'re more expensive than they\\'re\\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\\ntrend-driven market.

Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn\\'t offer the power that some 4-doors\\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let\\'s take another example: the\\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.
